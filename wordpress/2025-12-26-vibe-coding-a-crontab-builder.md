I made a few tweaks to my [crontab builder](https://teknostatik.github.io/misc/cron-expression-builder.html) yesterday. It's one of a few vibe-coded applications I created just to see what's possible, and it's something that actually works quite well for someone who doesn't use cron often, so needs to read the manual every time. This is exactly where generative AI is really useful; creating simple web applications that help people use their computer more effectively. 

For creating things like this I use Github CoPilot within Visual Studio Code, and then Github pages to host the results. It's all things that are either free or that I get _for_ free because I work in education, so is a setup that many other people could put together easily. It doesn't require a powerful computer or a fast internet connection, so if you can run Visual Studio Code then working in this way is definitely an option.
