I was reading [this blog post](https://emilywebber.co.uk/team-taxonomies-for-digital-data-and-technology-organisations/) by Emily Webber last week, which nicely compliments the Team Taxonomies book, and is something I think might add some value in my organisation. It puts enabling teams on a more level footing, defines _who_ they enable, and also records whether a team is long-lived or temporary. This would allow organisations to record project teams in the same way as long-lived teams, and might better help highlight people who are in too many teams, as well as teams that don't have a clear purpose.

I think mapping existing operating models in this way would be a good first step towards designing _new_ operating models.

I would like to get my personal profiles idea off the ground soon. It's like team charters/APIs, but for individuals. I think it's really important to understand how each person in a team works, especially if you are in that team, and so much friction that I see between individuals would likely be reduced if each person had something written down about what they are responsible for, how they like to work, and how best to get in touch with them. I think this is likely something I will just have to try myself to see how it works, before suggesting that other people adopt it, but it definitely works for me on a theoretical level.
