I finished reading _How Bad Are Bananas?_ by Mike Berners-Lee this week. I've read bits of the first edition before, but this is my first full reading of the revised edition that takes into account a lot of the recent technological advances. It's good to know that I'm on the right lines with the way I live my life, but there were definitely some learning points:

* Most of the emissions from electrical devices come from the way they are made, not from how they are used. So the biggest positive impact we can have is to use devices for as long as possible, and only replace them when they no longer work. This makes devices that can be upgraded/repaired extra valuable, because it means that their lifespan can be prolonged by adding a new hard drive or some memory. The book was talking about trying to keep computers for 10 years, phones for 5, and televisions/monitors for longer.

* Every little helps, but so many things that people concentrate on (sending less emails, using less paper) are really just yak-shaving compared to the things that make a real difference, such as not flying, eating a plant-based diet, and using renewable energy where possible. Transport and food are where most people can make the most difference, so it's a really good place to start.

* Cycling is a great way to travel, but we also need to think about how we fuel that cycling. The book talked about cycle commuting powered purely by cheeseburgers as being no better for the planet than driving a petrol car, and it's definitely something I need to start thinking more about. It was also interesting to find out that when you take fuel into account, an e-bike is _slightly_ better because it requires less energy from the rider, and therefore less fuel from food. Coupled with a renewable energy source, it it probably the best way to commute.

* Both of the ways I commute are relatively good for the planet, so I shouldn't feel guilty about taking the Brompton onto the train sometimes. It costs money, but requires me to eat less, and also allows me to read and listen to music or podcasts during the train part of the commute. Sometimes that is what I need, and in the scheme of things it's still a really good travel choice (as is buying a bike that will likely outlive me).

* Bananas are a good sourced of fuel in the scheme of things, so I shouldn't worry about the amount of them that I eat. They have long been one of my main cycling snacks, and I'm glad that the book doesn't suggest I should stop this.
