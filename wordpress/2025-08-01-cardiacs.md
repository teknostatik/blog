Last weekend I watched a Cardiacs gig from 1988 on the internet. It was a great blast from the past, and I definitely recognised a few people in the chat.

Today I pre-ordered [LSD](https://alphabet-business-concern.bandcamp.com/album/lsd), their new album. I never thought this record would be finished, but it's out in a few weeks, and as there is a new singer I suppose it's possible that this lineup could even tour if they wanted to. I _think_ they are still the band I have seen live the most anyway, but it would be good to get the opportunity again.

This band are so important to me, and I really thought the story was over when Tim died. But I love [the new single](https://alphabet-business-concern.bandcamp.com/track/woodeneye) and have high hopes for the album as well.

I also bought the reissue of _On Land and in the Sea_ this week, and it was great to get post that had a very familiar flower on a sticker on the front. Next time this happens it will be something new, which hasn't happened for a long time.
