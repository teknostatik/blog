# Albums of the Year 2025

2025 was another year that saw the return of bands I did not think I would be writing about again. A new Cardiacs album is always something to praise loudly, and this one in particular is one that very few people though would ever see the light of day. But it's here, it's great, and it's what I've listened to more than anything during the second half of this year. I've also bought less vinyl, and less new music in general, but as a result have rediscovered a lot of older things by people on this list and other adjacent artists. 

I have also not been to a concert that wasn't streamed on the internet for the 5th year running. Maybe 2026 will be the year that changes.

_In all cases the links below are to somewhere you can listen to and/or buy the record in question (Bandcamp or the artist’s own website). For things you can’t buy anymore I’ve linked to a description. All quotes are from the same page as the link unless otherwise mentioned._

## Albums

### [The Bad Fire](https://mogwai.bandcamp.com/album/the-bad-fire) by Mogwai

>The arrival of a new Mogwai album – their eleventh – is cause for great celebration. The album’s title, The Bad Fire, is a working-class Glaswegian term for Hell. It reflects the difficult time that members of the band were going through. New to the studio was American producer John Congleton, known for his work with Explosions In The Sky, Sigur Rós, John Grant and pretty much everyone in between. Congleton’s work can be heard on the album’s three singles. The album opener “God Gets You Back” sounds like Daft Punk being hunted by My Bloody Valentine, while “Fanzine Made Of Flesh” sounds like a victory parade for a baby yeti; and “Lion Rumpus” does actually sound like a lion rumpus. The music of Mogwai is a difficult thing to describe, but an easy thing to experience. At punishing volume, it can annihilate your body, leaving you as little more than a head which should by rights fall helplessly to the ground. Yet the music contains an updraft, a sense of beauty encased in the onslaught. This holds you up, suspended and empowered, reminding you that paradise is your birthright. This is especially true of The Bad Fire. It may have been created in dark conditions, but all that is transcended by the act of four musicians working together here, now, in the moment – the only place where Mogwai exist.

I mentioned this at the end of _last_ year's list, and it didn't disappoint. I'm not sure it's their _best_ album, but it's certainly up there with them, and it's something that I have found myself returning to at various points in the year. 

### [Reservoir of Love](https://viciouscircle.bandcamp.com/album/reservoir-of-love-2) by Shannon Wright

>Shannon Wright is an utterly distinctive songwriter coated in raw, indelible fury. Wright's songwriting hypnotizes, whether she's igniting her ravenous guitar, or swirling her remarkable trance-inducing piano, Wright's intensity draws you in and refuses to let up, therein lies the real beauty of her music.

The quote above was from the Bandcamp blurb from a previous album, but applies very much to this one. This was my first foray into the world of Shannon Wright, but it definitely won't be my last as I've loved everything I've heard. Each song could have been recorded 20 years ago or last week, but it's a timeless quality I love, and an album where the songs just speak for themselves.

### [End of the Middle](https://richardmichaeldawson.bandcamp.com/album/end-of-the-middle) by Richard Dawson

>The title of Richard Dawson's new album End of the Middle is a suitably slippery contradiction, one that invites multiple interpretations: Middle-aging? Middle-class? The middle-point of Dawson's career? The centre of a record? Centrism in general? Polarisation? The possibility of having a balanced discussion about anything? Stuck in the middle with you? Middle England? Middling songwriting?

Another artist who never fails to deliver. I wasn't sure about this when I heard the concept, but of course when I heard the _songs_ I understood. These are no ordinary kitchen-sink dramas, and whilst it might not be as epic as some of his recent records it is still well worth a few listens. I suspect there are a few people who will start with this, work backwards, and wonder what they have got themselves into, but I think very few of them will stop until they have heard everything this truly unique artist has ever recorded. It might only be my third favourite Richard Dawson record, but it's still better than most of the rest of this list.

### [Four Five](https://sweetwilliams.bandcamp.com/album/four-five) by Sweet Williams

>45 songs to commemorate 45 years of Sweet Williams aka Thomas House. Patchwork quilt or collaged map, this is his weirdest, funniest and darkest record to date.

This was not the Sweet Williams record I expected. Bundled with 2024's eponymous album was a CD of demos, which claimed to be for his next album. But then instead we get 45 different songs, none of which were on that demo, and all of which contribute to making a record that demands time, but is then time well spent. Not everyone has time for triple albums in 2025, but there are three of them on this list (and a true double), which to be fair I only really made time for by listening to them during the endless dog walks and occasional train commutes that gave this year some structure and meaning.

### [Crooked Wing](https://thesenewpuritans.bandcamp.com/album/crooked-wing) by These New Puritans

>Crooked Wing is These New Puritans' long-awaited fifth album—their first in six years. Produced by Bark Psychosis pioneer Graham Sutton and Jack Barnett, and executive produced by George Barnett, it features an unpredictable lineup of collaborators, from Caroline Polachek to veteran jazz bassist Chris Laurence. The cult duo returns with one of 2025's boldest and most immersive records, shifting from the brutal to the beautiful. Crooked Wing cements TNP's status as visionaries—defying genre, rejecting convention, and delivering their most moving, powerful work yet.

I feel like These New Puritans are the closest we have today to the musical vibe of late Talk Talk and Bark Psychosis. I've been a fan for a while, and have listened to this album a _lot_ this year. It's shorter than a lot of my other choices, and so fits more easily into the time slots I have to _listen_ to music rather than just hear it. It's also made me revisit some of their older albums, with _Field of Reeds_ in particular getting a lot of plays this year.

### [Skylarks](https://haress.bandcamp.com/album/skylarks) by HARESS

>Third album from acclaimed Shropshire collective and the much-anticipated follow-up to 2022's Ghosts. Dark, traditional and magically cosmic sounds from deep within Rural Britain. With 2022's critically acclaimed album Ghosts, enigmatic Shropshire group HARESS marked out their own place in a growing landscape of artists navigating the worlds of the traditional and the rural in new ways.

_"Far above the skylark sings_  
_And beats the air with joyful wings_  
_Till all the sky with music rings_  
_At high noon of the day"_

A worthy successor to _Ghosts_, and one of a number of albums on this list that has almost no lyrics.

### [We Invented Work For The Common Good](https://aaagripper.bandcamp.com/album/we-invented-work-for-the-common-good) by AAA Gripper

>AAA Gripper have seemingly dropped out of nowhere but the story goes back. The idea was conjured in the summer of 2023 at the first Wrong Speed Records festival in the town of Glastonbury. Recording hours and hours of bass and drums in deep Somerset then editing it down to a sharp and concise 32 minutes... Wild guitar strafe and precise hyper vocal added. We Invented Work For The Common Good is a deep dive into the world of the working person—how we end up, why we climb onto the conveyor belt and never get off.

Can we call them a supergroup? Another Wrong Speed Records collaboration that have made a fantastic debut album that is another of those modern classics that very few people outside a very small circle have heard _of_, let alone heard. If you like guitar music it's worth a listen, and if you love Joeyfat (see further down for some links to their music) then the two bands share a singer, and a general vibe.

### [GOLLIWOG](https://billywoods.bandcamp.com/album/golliwog) by billy woods

>GOLLIWOG is billy woods' first album in two years, preceded by 2023's Maps. GOLLIWOG is a haunting collection that weaves horror, humor, surrealism and Afropessimism into a cinematic tapestry, aided and abetted by a murderer's row of producers. African zombies, time traveling trap cars, malevolent ragdolls and a dying Frantz Fanon are just a few of the revelers in woods' danse macabre. GOLLIWOG is another triumph in the woods oeuvre, as layered and compelling as anything he has ever done.

My hip-hop discovery of the year, and a really inventive piece of music. Hearing this for the first time sent me into his back catalogue, and also into the other things he's released _this_ year which are also fantastic:

* [gowillog](https://billywoods.bandcamp.com/album/gowillog) by August Fanon & billy woods
* [Mercy](https://armandhammer.bandcamp.com/album/mercy) by Armand Hammer & The Alchemist

I know very little about this kind of music, but I want to know more.

### [Instant Holograms On Metal Film](https://stereolab.bandcamp.com/album/instant-holograms-on-metal-film) by Stereolab

One of my all time favourite bands, who I never thought would record together again. This picks up where all their other records left off, and just sounds so familiar but also so new at the same time. I'm hopeful that this is the start of something new rather than just a coda.

### [LSD](https://alphabet-business-concern.bandcamp.com/album/lsd) by Cardiacs

>Once again sweet listener it falls upon The Alphabet Business Concern to magnanimously spurn all praise and self-congratulation for bringing into existence yet another wondrous creation such as this splendid recording that you hold in your sweating, clasping hands and indeed, to mete out both thanks and appreciation to some distinguished associates for their help and talents that were so cunningly used in the process to varying degrees and with debatable effect. 

Earlier this year I watched a Cardiacs gig from 1988 on the internet. It was a great blast from the past, and I definitely recognised a few people in the chat. The day after I pre-ordered [LSD](https://alphabet-business-concern.bandcamp.com/album/lsd), their new album. I never thought this record would be finished, but now it is. This band are so important to me, and I really thought the story was over when Tim died. But I loved [the first single](https://alphabet-business-concern.bandcamp.com/track/woodeneye) and the album itself was even better; a mix of the old and familiar with a new line up that may even have the potential to make more new music in the future.

It's probably my album of the year, of the decade so far, and something I think I'll keep coming back to in the way I do with many of their other albums (some of which have been with me over 30 years).

>And lest we forget, our fallen comrades, Tim Smith and Tim Quy, sorely missed. 

### [RUN AWAY WITH A WILD AND A RARE ONE](https://wavegenerators.bandcamp.com/album/run-away-with-a-wild-and-a-rare-one) by WAVE GENERATORS

>ALL SONGS WRITTEN & PERFORMED by WAVE GENERATORS — WAVE GENERATORS = HEIGHT KEECH & NOSAJ FROM NEW KINGDOM; produced by Height Keech, mixed and mastered by Steel Tipped Dove.

Described as _the Fugazi of hip-hop_, which is a phrase that is always gong to make me listen, as I like both of these things. This record makes me feel how I felt when I heard the first Rage Against The Machine album, and it's a perfect mix of genres that ends up being much more than the sum of its' parts. This is their second album, but both fit easily together on one CD, and this is very much music that _should_ be burned on CD and listened to as a body of work. It won't take long, and it's very much worth it.

### [Yoo II avec Nolan Potter](https://yoodooright.bandcamp.com/album/yoo-ii-avec-nolan-potter) by Yoo Doo Right, Population II & Nolan Potter

>Experimental rockers Yoo Doo Right team up with multi-instrumentalist virtuoso Nolan Potter and psychedelic rock trio Population II to record a one-of-a-kind long-player meshing elements from krautrock, free jazz, and noise.

This is definitely head music. I got into Yoo Doo Right at the end of last year, and this record builds on what has gone before but adds a shot of jazz and krautrock from their collaborators. It's perfect music for doing something else to, but also good to just listen and _be_.

### [Unfolding](https://jessicamoss.bandcamp.com/album/unfolding) by Jessica Moss

>Unfolding is Jessica Moss's most meditative and plaintive solo album… Layers of violin melody, electroacoustic processing, intermittent voice, and percussion from The Necks drummer Tony Buck yield deeply emotive genre-defying compositions, guided by a spirit of searching and summoning that unfolds in a prevailing atmosphere of incantation and mournful restraint.

Another album with very few words, and something else that I've spent a lot of time working to. Definitely something that demands being listened to all in one go, and it's short enough to do so.

### [Touch](https://intlanthem.bandcamp.com/album/touch) by Tortoise

>[First new Tortoise music in nine years - description to be added]

The Cardiacs and Stereolab albums were a genuine surprise, but this isn't actually far behind. It's been a while since Tortoise released an album, and even longer since there was one this good (Probably _Standards_ by my reckoning). I'm not sure this will win them many new fans, but it also won't lose them any old ones.

### [Implosion](https://thebugvsghostdubs.bandcamp.com/album/implosion) by The Bug vs Ghost Dubs

>When Chuck D proclaimed "Bass, how low can you go?" on Public Enemy's anthemic 'Bring the Noise,' maybe he was pre-empting or inciting the 10,000 fathoms-deep, spine-bending basslines and sub-quake tremors of 'Implosion.'
>
>Implosion is a crushing split album, appropriately released on The Bug's own PRESSURE label. Mapping out a new form of spectral dub, the sound is deliberately immersive, introverted, and yes, definitely implosive. In pursuit of heavy lids, blurred vision, and merciless bass bin punishment, it’s one part meditation, two parts low-end theory, and essentially a confession of devoted sound system addiction. 

I have no other words, but these words do it justice. I've listened to this and the Necks album on repeat for most of December so far and after a few listens it all starts to make perfect sense. 

### [Disquiet](https://thenecksau.bandcamp.com/album/disquiet) by The Necks

>On Disquiet, The Necks stretch their immersive, shape-shifting sound across three discs and more than three hours of labyrinthine, patient intensity. This is their twentieth studio recording and it marks the 39th year of the band’s existence.
>
>Meticulously recorded and sculpted, the four extended pieces on Disquiet see Tony Buck, Chris Abrahams, and Lloyd Swanton pushing at the outer edges of their collective intuition, building and unraveling hypnotic structures with microscopic focus. Present is the usual arsenal of piano, double bass, and drums, and all the in-between of sounds undefined and sources obscured. 

Another musical discovery from last year, delivering a triple album this time (including the longest pieced of music in my collection, at over 70 minutes just for that one track). This has been the album I've turned to a lot during the last couple of months of the year, and I've somehow found the time to listen to it more times than you would expect for something that's over 3 hours long and not available on Spotify. It's probably not the most accessible introduction, but definitely representative of the kind of music they have been making for the last few years. I also think this is a band I could see live, because I think they would suit the kind of venue that I like best (places that don't feel like they were designed for rock concerts, but that have great acoustics anyway).

### [You Heartbreaker, You](https://jehnnybeth.bandcamp.com/album/you-heartbreaker-you) by Jehnny Beth

>[Second solo album from Jehnny Beth - description to be added]

Talking of concerts, Jhenny Beth played at the last two I went to (the 2020 6 Music festival, and a warm up show the night before). This record builds on her solo debut, and is nothing like her collaboration with Bobby Gillespie (which I also love). I suspect these songs sound amazing live, and she's definitely another artist I would consider going back to concerts for.

### [Mr. Luck And Ms. Doom](https://thedelines.bandcamp.com/album/mr-luck-and-ms-doom) by The Delines

>Country soul from Portland, Oregon. The Delines return with their new album featuring Amy Boone's vocals, Cory Gray's keyboards and trumpet, and Willy Vlautin's storytelling songs about characters on the margins—featuring tales of people struggling with their pasts, bad luck, and the search for redemption.

I've loved them since their debut, and this latest release doesn't disappoint. I didn't buy many things on vinyl this year, but this was one I pre-ordered without too much thought as music like this just sounds better that way.

### [Wasteland](https://jimghedi.bandcamp.com/album/wasteland) by Jim Ghedi

>On his new album Wasteland, Jim Ghedi has created something huge. Intense, brooding, bold, at times apocalyptic, and remarkably vast. A profoundly bold sonic statement that is some of the most rich, far-reaching and ambitious work that Ghedi has created to date - pushing the boundaries of what folk music can be in 2025. Wasteland is a record that is unafraid to plunge into the darkness of the modern world and embrace the weirder, edgier and more unnerving moments that come from doing so. It is an album that captures all the enormity of life from the micro to the macro, zooming in on the personal as well reflecting on broader societal issues.

This was something I found on one of Bandcamp's lists of new music, and it immediately made me want to check out his other work (which is different, but also great). It's folk music, but also something that sounds like it could be made in any year where it was possible to record music, and a good few years before. I think we need songs like these at the moment.

### [Twilight Override](https://jefftweedy.bandcamp.com/album/twilight-override) by Jeff Tweedy

>30 tracks produced by Jeff Tweedy with Tom Schick. Recorded at The Loft in Chicago. Performed by Jeff Tweedy, Spencer Tweedy, Sammy Tweedy, James Elkington, Sima Cunningham, Macie Stewart and Liam Kazar.

Another triple album, and a collection of songs that stands up to the last few Wilco albums, but also sounds like it was a lot more fun to make. This is what I've been listening to when I just want to experience great songs, sung well.

### [That's What the Music Is For](https://theapartments.bandcamp.com/album/thats-what-the-music-is-for) by The Apartments

Another album that celebrates the simple art of songwriting. I will definitely explore their large back catalogue soon.
