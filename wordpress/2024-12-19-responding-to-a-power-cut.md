We had a short power cut earlier this week, Which was a good test of the power resilience we have configured in the caravan. We are using _some_ kit that requires constant electricity to function, but try and ensure that anyone who is working can continue to work for a few hours in the event of losing electricity.

And that's exactly what happened. When our main router lost power, devices seamlessly connected to the secondary one (which has a battery), and the internet continued to work. There was no report of a loss of connection, just of one monitor powering off. We actually got as far as unplugging the monitor to swap it out before we realised that other devices in the van were also without power, and that the monitor was actually fine.

If we were using our USB-C monitors then we probably wouldn't have noticed, which is a good indication that things are working largely as expected.

As I'm not working this week I'm using my more powerful mini-pc because I wanted to give it a decent road test. It didn't survive the outage, but did restart as soon as power was back. I probably need a better solution if I am going to used this type of computer more, but if I was using my work setup I would have been fine until either the battery in my laptop or in the backup router gave out. 

There is more we could do, but it was good to be able to validate our current setup here.
