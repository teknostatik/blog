I was reading [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1r8fdud/i_gave_my_ai_agent_50_bucks_and_told_it_to_buy/) about someone who gave an AI $50 and tasked them to use it to make enough to buy a Mac Mini. See [here](https://fromearendel.com/) for the website it created to sell prompts it has created, and to read more about the journey it is on. I find this very interesting, especially because the prompts in the free starter pack are _very_ good.

I think this experiment is definitely worth keeping an eye on.
