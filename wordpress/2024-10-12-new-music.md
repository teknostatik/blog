New music that I have enjoyed recently includes:

* [Psychotic Spew](https://blackends.bandcamp.com/album/psychotic-spew-2) by Black Ends
* [Absolute Elsewhere](https://bloodincantation.bandcamp.com/album/absolute-elsewhere) by Blood Incantation
* [Courage](https://helpifuckingneedit.bandcamp.com/album/courage) by Help 
* [Memorial Waterslides](https://memorialsmusic.bandcamp.com/album/memorial-waterslides) by Memorial

Plus of course all the records I wrote about last week. This is a quite angry list, but maybe that's just a reflection on the week I've had.
