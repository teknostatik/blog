Over the last few months I have been involved in building an Agile Community of Practice at my workplace. It's up to over 150 members and is going well. This post attempts to collate some of the resources we used, and blog posts that proved insightful when deciding what we wanted to do.

We started with [Emily Webber's blog](https://emilywebber.co.uk/), and also her excellent book _Building successful communities of practice_. But there were a few other websites that we also useful:

* <https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/community-development-handbook/community-development-handbook>
* <https://opensource.com/open-organization/20/2/building-community-practice-5-steps>
* <https://communitiesofpractice.work/#tools>
* <https://hellotacit.com/building-successful-communities-of-practice/>

I hope to add more to this list as I read up more on the subject.
