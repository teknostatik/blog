I've used Evolution as my main mail client for ages, but it really doesn't like my EeePC, so I thought I'd give Thunderbird a try. Not only does it display all my folders and messages far more clearly, but with the addition of a couple of extensions it makes navigation and moving messages a whole lot easier.

I'm still going to use Evolution at work, because I'm very much tied to Exchange, but I think for home use Thunderbird has come on a lot in the two years since I used it last, and I should at least give it a chance.
