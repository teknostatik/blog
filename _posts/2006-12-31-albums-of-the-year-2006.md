_Worked out through seeing which albums got the most plays in iTunes, with a bit of seasonal adjustment for those released towards the end of the year - These are not really in any order._

The Killers - Sam's Town  
Loose Fur - Born Again in the USA  
Guillemots - Through the Window Pane  
Thom Yorke - The Eraser  
The Fratellis - Costello Music  
Joanna Newsom - Ys  
Isobel Campbell and Mark Lanegan - Ballad of the Broken Seas  
Jenny Lewis with the Watson Twins - Rabbit Fur Coat  
Midlake - The Trials of Van Occupanther  
Sonic Youth - Rather Ripped

This has been a very good year for albums, with at least 5 others that would have made my top 10 on any other year.
