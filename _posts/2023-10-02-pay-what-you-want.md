I often download albums that have been made freely available, and then end up buying the record anyway. It's definitely a way I have discovered new music for a while, and very rarely leads to me not giving the artist money for _something_, even if it is not that particular record.

Here is list of music currently available on a pay-what-you-want basis. It's accurate as of 30th September 2023, but I do intend on trying to keep this as up to date as possible. For the first three sections it's worth looking directly on their Bandcamp pages, and even if things change, then there is always _something_ on offer.

## Wrong Speed Records

This is my favourite record label right now, and I own a fair few of these on vinyl or cassette. If you don't care about having a physical copy then you can pay whatever you want for these.

## Legendary Pink Dots and related

The band that started me on this quest often add/remove things from they pay-what-you-want list, but these are the ones that seem to be on it the most. If you do find physical copies of this music then just buy it, because they don't stick around for long.
