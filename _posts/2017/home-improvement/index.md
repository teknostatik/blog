We went to Ikea today, ostensibly for a new desk for my study. Evernote tells me I did the measurements for this desk over two years ago, so it's probably about time. As well as a desk, we also picked up a new kitchen table (replacing one that's probably 15 years old) and a new coffee/gaming table for the living room (replacing one that's nearly as old as I am). We also picked up some stools and a couple of iPad holders each to make it easier to use what are fast becoming our primary computers in a number of different ways. Everything smells new and wooden, and I love it all.

I now need to work out how I want my new desk set up. I long ago accepted that my IT needs are less than they were when I actually worked in IT, and as a result I probably don't need to have quite so many computers in circulation. How that is going to work with a larger desk I'm not sure, but I'm hoping I can at least be a little sensible when I'm deciding what actually needs to be reassembled _tonight_.

I'm also hoping this new setup will mean I can dismantle the standing desk I built on the living room fridge a year or so ago. It only houses a Raspberry Pi now, and it's not really a useful workstation because the dog hates me using it to the point where she barks incessantly and/or tries to jump on my (non-existent) lap.

I like new things, and I suspect this is only phase one of a fairly major decluttering and renovation exercise that is long overdue.
