I probably listened to less new music this year than any year in the last decade, although I definitely listened to each new record _more_, which was very much my intention at the start of the year. I also reverted to buying physical copies of music wherever possible (either on vinyl or on CD), which lead to me setting up my old stereo in my study and only really listening to digital music through Spotify or when I was on the move.

Did this change the sort of music I listened to? I don’t think so, but I definitely found myself exploring the back catalogues of several of the artists responsible for the records below in a way I probably wouldn’t have in previous years, and I think that might have lead to the list being _slightly_ more biased towards established artists I already owned music by than new discoveries and more diverse genres.

The list I’ve come up with for this year (in alphabetical order) is:

Aldous Harding - _Party_ Belle & Sebastian - _How to Solve Our Human Problems (part 1)_ The Big Moon - _Love in the 4th Dimension_ Big Thief - _Capacity_ Bjork - _Utopia_ British Sea Power - _Let the Dancers Inherit the Party_ Cigarettes After Sex - _Cigarettes After Sex_ Colter Wall - _Colter Wall_ Conor Oberst - _Salutations_ Destroyer - _Ken_ The Fall - _New Facts Emerge_ Father John Misty - _Pure Comedy_ Here Lies Man - _Here Lies Man_ Idles - _Brutalism_ The Indelicates - _Juniverbrecher_ Lorde - _Melodrama_ Los Campesinos! - _Sick Scenes_ Lost Horizons - _Ojala_ Mac DeMarco - _This Old Dog_ Mark Eitzel - _Hey Mr Ferryman_ Michael Head & The Red Elastic Band - _Adios Señor Pussycat_ The National - _Sleep Well Beast_ The New Pornographers - _Whiteout Conditions_ Richard Dawson - _Peasant_ Ryan Adams - _Prisoner_ Slowdive - _Slowdive_ Sun Kil Moon - _Common as Light and Love are Red Valleys of Blood_ This is the Kit - _Moonshine Freeze_ The Unthanks - _Diversions vol. 4 : The Songs and Poems of Molly Drake_ The Wedding Present - _George Best 30_ Yorkston/Thorne/Khan - _Neuk Wight Delhi All-stars_
