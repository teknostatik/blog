2017 is going to be a year of watching films, largely because of the wonders of Cineworld Unlimited membership, but also because I watched far too few films in 2016. The following are the ones I watched in the first month of membership:

### Rogue One

I wasn't sure how much I would enjoy this. I'm a huge Star Wars fan, but I didn't know how much I wanted something that was set in the same universe but didn't contain any of my favourite characters. As it turns out I think it's my fourth favorite film in the franchise (after _Empire Strikes Back_, _A New Hope_ and _The Force Awakens_), and I've already added the DVD to my wish list as I'd quite like to watch it again when I'm not dying from some sort of chest infection.

### Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them

I saw this straight after _Rogue One_ (about 10 minutes after in fact), but it was enjoyable enough and entertained me without making me think too much. At the time that was a welcome distraction, but I suspect I'll never watch it again until I binge watch the whole series at some undefined point in the future.

### Passengers

This is a film that seems to divide opinions. Personally I liked it, and I thought it provoked some interesting moral discussions. There are things I would have changed, but the basic premise is an interesting one, and I'm not sure most of the negativity I've heard about it is justified (which I can't really expand on without major spoilers).

### Assassin's Creed

I'm really not sure about this. It was ok, but probably the only example this month of something that I'm glad I didn't _really_ pay to see (two films a month covers membership). I also thought it was _far_ too loud, and I found my dislike of loud noise getting in the way of my enjoyment of the film.

### La La Land

I usually don't like musicals, or films that feature a romance between the two main characters as a major plot. _Passengers_ cured me of the second one, but _La La Land_ pretty much dealt the killer blow on both. I love this film, and I can not only relate to both main characters, but I actually liked the music quite a lot as well. Probably the best film I've seen this month, and something I will definitely come back to.

### Lion

"Based on a true story" explains a lot of what puzzled me about this film, and I'm sure that if it _wasn't_ based on a true story then a lot of things might have happened differently. That said, I really enjoyed it and while it was nothing like the trailer, it was a pleasant enough way to spend a Sunday afternoon and certainly managed to provoke a genuinely emotional reaction at times.

That's more films than I watched in the whole of the year before (certainly at the cinema), and I've already got quite a long list for the next 11 months.
