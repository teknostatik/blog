I went in to the new [Apple Store](https://www.apple.com/uk/retail/birmingham/) in Birmingham today. I've been meaning to go for ages, but as I'm not _really_ in the market for anything new then I've not seen it as a pressing task. My main reason for going was to try out the keyboards on the new [MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/uk/macbook-pro/) to see if it's something I could live with if I end up getting one at some point in the future. It's very different to the keyboards I'm used to (the previous generation of MacBook Pro/Air, and also the Apple bluetooth keyboard and my Logitech solar powered keyboard). There is definitely less movement of the keys as I type, but my accuracy didn't take a hit, and I think I could grow to accept it as a keyboard for everyday use. I also thought the screen was gorgeous, and that 8GB of RAM would be enough for most of what I use a laptop for these days, especially as the SSD is so fast. I'm not going to rush out and buy one, but I wouldn't rule it out at some point in the future (although the touch bar still leaves me cold).

I also looked at the [MacBook](https://www.apple.com/uk/macbook/) (small, similar keyboard, would make a decent MacBook Air replacement in a year or two), and the larger [iPad Pro](https://www.apple.com/uk/ipad-pro/) (huge, beautiful screen, surprisingly good typing experience with the Smart Keyboard). Neither of these are things I _need_, but I would happily use as my main portable device if the opportunity presented itself, and actually _touching_ the iPad made me realise why so many people are saying they can use it as their main computer. I use my smaller iPad Air 2 for _a lot_ of what I do online outside of work, and I can see how twice the memory and a much larger screen would help me leave my laptop behind forever (although I also want to wait and see what the next iteration of the device might look like).

I'm still hoping Apple bring out a desktop computer that excites me this year (because that _is_ something I'll need to buy soon as I fear my 2011 Mac Mini will be obsolete within a year or so). I would _use_ anything they currently have on the market (with the right upgrades), but as I've not actually bought any of them then it suggests that there is nothing currently out there that is suitable enough for me to consider an upgrade at this point in time.
