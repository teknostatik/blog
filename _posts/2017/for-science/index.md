Yesterday we visited the town of La Laguna, home of two museums, but also a lot of other impressive things to look at (architecture, graffiti, churches etc.). For me this was the highlight of the week so far, and it allowed me to see how the area I've been staying in developed over the centuries, and how history touched it and shaped it to be what it is today.

The first museum was a museum of history, which reminded me a little of the Museum of London in that it laid out the history of Tenerife chronologically so as to take visitors through the same journey the island has undertaken over the centuries. Thankfully there was commentary in English (I don't normally bother with these, but my Spanish is bad enough that it was worth it). I saw a lot of impressive paintings and old books, and also took around 100 photographs which I'll do something with when I get home.

After lunch we took a short tram ride to the science museum, which was basically a large concrete bunker full of all the usual sorts of things you see in a science museum. It wasn't particularly innovative, but it was fun, and we ended up staying there a couple of hours and interacting with pretty much _everything_. Again, I photographed everything, and between the two museums and the town itself I probably have close to 300 pictures.

It's our last day here today, and we leave _very_ early tomorrow, so I suspect we will be having a lazy day today. It's been a good holiday though, and this is a place I will definitely come back to at some point in the future.
