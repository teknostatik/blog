It's 2017. It's been 2017 for a while, but as I was ill for most of the Christmas holidays, today is the first time I've really thought about the fact that it's a new year, and that I'm back at work tomorrow.

I don't really make resolutions, but I think I may be kicking off some new projects in 2017.

Towards the end of December we bought year-long Cineworld unlimited cards, which means we need to see two films per month (at least), or something like 22 or 23 over the year. We have seen three so far (in three days). Seeing films as they come out gives me something new to blog about, so I'll likely be writing about some of them, especially if I feel I've got something to add that I've not read elsewhere.

I started using my iPad more (and my computer less) a couple of months ago, and I'm finding that to be sufficiently liberating that I might want to blog about it. I feel slightly less enthusiastic about the Surface Pro 4 I use for work now, but I may also find that there are Windows 10/Surface Pro specific things I want to blog about as well.

I plan on buying a lot less music this year, and using Spotify for pretty much everything to do with discovering and playing new music. I have my existing collection available on all my devices anyway, but this year I want Spotify to be the default way I consume music (unless it's vinyl of course). I don't plan on buying much more than what I get with my Rough Trade subscription (11 records, plus whatever freebies I get), although I will be putting things I really like on my wish list around birthday and Christmas time (so June and December). My hope is that I'll spend a lot less on music, and will also get to spend more time with things I _do_ buy. As a. result of this I won't be posting monthly lists of things I've listened to, but might start writing about specific things in more depth. Today I bought a new perspex box that will fit around 20 records in it, and that should be all my music-related storage needs sorted for this year (which is just as well as I'm running out of space).

I didn't do a great deal of socialising for most of 2016, for a variety of reasons. I don't really have a plan to fix this, although starting a new job a month ago has already shaken things up a little in that respect and it's quite possible that it will sort itself out organically. If nothing else, I'm going to be going to the cinema a _lot_ more this year, which is a step in the right direction.

I might of course do none of these things and do something else instead, but I thought it was worth a statement of intent at the start of the year.
