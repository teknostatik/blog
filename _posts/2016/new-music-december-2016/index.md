In December I seem to have split my time between starting a new job and being ill. Neither of these are conducive to discovering new music. I did manage to stumble upon a few things though.

Childish Gambino - _"Awaken My Love"_  
J. Cole - _4 Your Eyez Only_  
Run the Jewels - _Run The Jewels 3_  
Brian Eno - _Reflection_

This will be my last monthly roundup for a while. I've not _quite_ finalised what my blogging in 2017 will look like, although I expect it will involve albums of the month, a lot more writing about films I've seen, and perhaps more about using an iPad for the vast majority of my online life.
