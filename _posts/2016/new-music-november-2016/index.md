I have discovered lots of interesting music in November, including the long lost Sea Nymphs album that was recorded in 1991 but only released this year (and which can be bought from the [Cardiacs store](http://abc-mary.myshopify.com/collections/cds/products/the-sea-nymphs-on-the-dry-land-cd). There was also a surprising electronic Lambchop record and an equally surprisingly angry Moby record.

The Sea Nymphs - _On The Dry Land_  
Hope Sandoval and the Warm Inventions - _Until The Hunter_  
Sleaford Mods - _TCR_  
Marie Davidson - _Adieux Au Dancefloor_  
Lambchop - _Flotus_  
Moby and the Void Pacific Choir - _These Systems Are Failing_  
The Sweet Release of Death - _The Sweet Release of Death_.  
Emily Reo - _Spell 10"_
