Software I use that I feel is somewhat noteworthy includes:

- [Evernote](http://evernote.com) - I use this on every device I own, mostly to take notes in meetings and training sessions, and then to revise/reflect later. A lot of my notes are now photographs of whiteboards, which Evernote handles very well.
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) - A text editor that handles Markdown well, and can preview and export to PDF. This pretty much handles all of my writing/blogging work within one application. I'm currently writing this post in Atom. I also use [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) to convert to PDF, HTML and/or .docx if required.
- [Trello](https://trello.com) - I've just started using this for my to do list, and it's a good way to visualise the planning and execution of any task based work.
- [Keynote](https://www.apple.com/mac/keynote/) - For presentations. I wouldn’t say I’m a power user, but I can throw together a half decent presentation now.
- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) - Cloud storage and synching software to ensure I can access everything everywhere.
- [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) and [Buffer](https://buffer.com) - To automate as much as possible. Between them they handle a lot of the seemingly clever things in my digital life, and explain why I seem to be able to post to social media sites at times when I appear to be elsewhere.
- [NVivo](http://www.qsrinternational.com/products_nvivo.aspx) - As a lot of the data I work with is words rather than numbers this is proving somewhat invaluable. I use the Mac version, but should get round to exploring the Windows version soon as I understand it has some different features.
- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) - Because no-one needs as many physical computers as I had before virtualisation was a thing.

I'm always happy to talk about any of this software and how I use it to be productive.
