September is always a busy month for me. It's also a month where a lot of my favourite artists released records. This is just as well as I didn't really have time to find much else to listen to.

Teenage Fanclub - _Here_  
Wilco - _Schmilco_  
Angel Olsen - _My Woman_  
Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds - _Skeleton Tree_  
De La Soul - _And the Anonymous Nobody_  
Ryley Walker - _Golden Sings That Have Been Sung_  
Okkervil River - _Away_  
Amanda Palmer and Jason Webley - _Sketches for the Musical JIB_  
Hannah Peel - _Awake But Always Dreaming_
