As always, I've listened to a lot of new music this year. It's been my second year of collecting vinyl, and my second (and last) year of blogging about my monthly discoveries (2017 is likely to be a little too busy to commit to that for another year). This year I've split my choices into three categories - my top 10 albums by how many times I've played them, my top 10 vinyl purchases, and a selection of other things I've listened to this year that I really like.

## Top 10 from Last.fm

I've used last.fm to track my listening habits for the past 10 years. Whilst it doesn't track anything I listen to on vinyl (or in fact CD), it does cover everything I've listened to on my computer, my phone and my iPad, on a variety of different music players. The following albums are my top 5 based on that criteria, although it should be noted that I also own the Unloved album on vinyl so there is a chance I've actually listened to it more than anything else this year.

She Makes War – _Direction of Travel_ Radiohead – _A Moon Shaped Pool_ Shearwater – _Jet Plane and Oxbow_ Unloved – _Guilty of Love_ Tortoise – _The Catastrophist_ PJ Harvey – _The Hope Six Demolition Project_ Frightened Rabbit – _Painting of a Panic Attack_ Jesu & Sun Kil Moon – _Jesu/Sun Kil Moon_ Yorkston/Thorne/Khan – _Everything Sacred_ The Wedding Present - _Going Going_

What strikes me about this list is that there are a lot of familiar names there, and I've listened to (and written about) most of these artists a lot in the past. The two new names on this list are She Wakes War (my favourite record of the year, and one that reminds me a lot of _Trouble Will Find Me_ by The National in both subject matter and my general emotional response to it) and Unloved (one of several "supergroup" records in my list this year, and one that I keep coming back to).

## 10 more that I've played a lot on vinyl

I started collecting vinyl again two years ago, and these are the ten records from 2016 that I keep coming back to (along with the Unloved album which I've already mentioned). It's interesting to note that only one of these (Black Mountain's IV) is a double album, and I'm now fairly sure that having something spread across more than one record does limit how much I listen to it.

Iggy Pop – _Post Pop Depression_ Minor Victories – _Minor Victories_ Angel Olsen – _My Woman_ Black Mountain - _IV_ Beyond the Wizard’s Sleeve – _The Soft Bounce_ Pixies – _Head Carrier_ Wild Beasts - _Boy King_ D.D Dumbo – _Utopia Defeated_ RM Hubbert – _Telling The Trees_ The Magnetic North – _Prospect of Skelmersdale_

This list probably owes a lot to the fact that I get sent one record a month by Rough Trade, and definitely features more newer artists, and debut records. I loved the idea of Minor Victories before I even heard the record (and hearing it didn't change that), and I really didn't expect another good Iggy Pop record (and certainly not one _that_ good). There isn't really a filler track on any of these, and all come highly recommended.

## My favourite records of the year (that I've not already mentioned)

This is very much the best of the rest, and also a few things I've not played that _often_, but would still say are my favourite records of the year.

Brian Eno – _The Ship_ BadBadNotGood – _IV_ Conor Oberst – _Ruminations_ Bon Ivor – _22, A Million_ Charlie Hilton - _Palana_ Moby and the Void Pacific Choir - _These Systems Are Failing_ Car Seat Headrest – _Teens of Denial_ Kate Tempest – _Let Them Eat Chaos_ Danny Brown – _Atrocity Exhibition_ Banks – _The Alter_ Melanie De Biasio - _Blackened Cities_ Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds – _Skeleton Tree_ Okkervil River – _Away_ James Blake – _The Colour in Anything_ Steve Mason - _Meet the Humans_ Knifeworld - _Bottled out of Eden_ Blixa Bargeld & Teho Teardo – _Nerissimo_ Shirley Collins - _Lodestar_ Cate Le Bon - _Crab Day_ Riley Walker - _Golden Sings That Have Been Sung_ Childish Gambino - _"Awaken My Love"_ Anderson .Paak - _Malibu_ Anohni - _Hopelessness_ DJ Shadow - _The Mountain Will Fall_ Wire - _Nocturnal Koreans_

This last list is much more diverse, with a lot of rap and R'n'B, a little jazz, and a fair few things that defy classification. I think it's a fair representation of my listening habits over the last year though.
