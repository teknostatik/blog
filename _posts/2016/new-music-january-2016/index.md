January has been a month overshadowed by the death of David Bowie (amongst others), but has also seen the release of some outstanding records, including a few my long-time musical heroes of mine. The new records by Tortoise and Shearwater did not disappoint, and the Jesu/Sun Kil Moon record is a particular treat that reminds me a little of the Sun Kil Moon/Album Leaf collaboration from a couple of years ago.

The full list for January is:

Hinds - _Leave me Alone_  
Bill Baird - _Earth into Ether_  
David Bowie - _Blackstar_  
Daughter - _Not to Disappear_  
Shearwater - _Jet Plane and Oxbow_  
Howes - _3.5 Degrees_  
Eleanor Friedberger - _New View_  
Tortoise - _The Catastrophist_  
Jesu & Sun Kil Moon - _Jesu/Sun Kil Moon_
