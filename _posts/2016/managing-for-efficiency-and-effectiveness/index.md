The latest module of my ILM5 training was called _Managing for efficiency and effectiveness_. I was a lot more comfortable with this as a subject than budgetary control, and my main learning point was that I was on the right track with a lot of the things I'm already doing, and that the way I organise myself and my time is fairly efficient and effective without me needing to make huge changes to how I work. I found it useful to compare the material in the session to research I've already done into Lean IT and Lean Six Sigma, and I'll be doing further comparison once I've gone through Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt training which starts tomorrow.

The only mildly uncomfortable thing we covered was around feedback, and as part of the assignment I've got to ask people I've managed, supervised or otherwise lead to feed back on my management style. I wrote some questions yesterday, made them into a questionnaire this morning, and will start sending it out to people tomorrow. I've never been particularly comfortable asking for feedback, but it's something that I think is very important as I think that regardless of how self-aware I might be, I'm always going to have blind spots.

As well as writing an assignment based on this feedback, I'll also be starting the main phase of my final project, which involves planning and executing a major change in the workplace. The work I'm going to be doing is related to Lean IT, and making the flow of work through a system as efficient as possible by optimising working processes. I'm hoping to start the serious work on this in the next couple of weeks, and will be presenting the results at a talk in June (which I'll probably repeat a couple of times for my team if all goes well).
