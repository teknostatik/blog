April has been a good month for music. I've found plenty to listen to on freezing walks to the train station in the morning, and significantly warmer journeys home. I've bought a few records, spent hours listening to Spotify, and yet this list only really scratches the surface of the music that's been released over the last month. It's still a long list though, and probably about as much new music as I can reasonably _listen to_ (as opposed to hear) in a month when I'm working every day and doing all the other things I do.

May will be a different kind of month as I'll be at home more; with a two week break from work and a couple of long weekends. I'm not sure if that will change how I listen to music (or what I listen to), but I know I am very much looking forward to it.

I'm not sure what my favourite record from this list is, although I do have a soft spot for _Direction of Travel_ by She Makes War. I've had this record a while, but it was properly released this month and I really hope a lot more people get to hear it. I'm also growing increasingly fond of The Magnetic North's - _Prospect of Skelmersdale_ which manages to make the town of Skelmersdale sound both beautiful and appealing (somehow).

My list for April is:

Black Mountain - _IV_  
She Makes War - _Direction of Travel_  
Yeasayer - _Amen and Goodnight_  
The Magnetic North - _Prospect of Skelmersdale_  
Mogwai - _Atomic_  
Frightened Rabbit - _Painting of a Panic Attack_  
Kevin Morby - _Singing Saw_  
PJ Harvey - _The Hope Six Demolition Project_  
Rufus Wainwright - _Take all my Loves_  
Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeroes - _Person A_  
Tinpan Orange - _Love is a Dog_  
Face+Heel - _Our Prince's Quarry_  
Brian Eno - _The Ship_ Guided by Voices - _Please be Honest_
