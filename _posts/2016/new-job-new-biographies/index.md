I start a new job on Thursday. I'll still be working for the University, but for a different department and on a different project. I'm currently at home using up the holiday I carried over from last year, and I've set aside today to update all publicly available biographies and blurbs to reflect this change, and also to try and ensure that Linkedin and Facebook represent my updated professional and personal networks.

As part of this I've updated the [about me](http://teknostatik.co.uk/about-me) section of this blog, plus the pages I maintain on [what I'm currently working on](http://teknostatik.co.uk/now) and [what hardware and software I'm using](http://teknostatik.co.uk/setup). I suspect all of these will see further revision once I've started, but they are at least more accurate than they were.
