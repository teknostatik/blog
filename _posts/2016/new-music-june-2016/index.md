My listening habits in June have been dominated by two records:

Mark Kozelek - _Mark Kozelek Sings Favourites_  
Minor Victories - _Minor Victories_

These two records belong together, with the singer from each project guesting on the other. Between them they feature a great many of my favourite musicians, and I didn't feel I need anything else to listen to much else during the first half of June.

A few other things from June (mostly towards the end):

Cat's Eyes - _Treasure House_  
Alexis Taylor - _Piano_  
Public Service Broadcast - _The Race for Space (remixes)_  
John Zorn - _The Mockingbird_  
Nice as Fuck - _Nice as Fuck_  
Nova Express Quintet - _Andras: The Book of Angels Vol. 28_  
The Body - _No One Deserves Happiness_  
Mitski - _Puberty 2_  
Margaret Glaspy - _Emotions & Math_
