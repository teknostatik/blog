I think I spent most of this month listening to a playlist of most of the recorded output of The Fall. This experiment may spawn a blog post at some point, but in the meantime here is a list of everything I listened to when I needed a break from the wonderful and frightening world of Mark E Smith.

Dinosaur Jr. - _Give a Glimpse of What Yer Not_  
Wild Beasts - _Boy King_  
Omar Rodriguez-Lopez - _Blind Worms, Pious Swine_  
David Konopnicki, Bertrand Delorme & Cyril Grimaud - _Book of Angels vol. 29_  
Blixa Bargeld, Teho Teardo - _Nerissimo_  
Peter Broderick - _Partners_  
John Paul White - _Beulah_

Some of this isn't available on Spotify, which makes the playlist quite short.
