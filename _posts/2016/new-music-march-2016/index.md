I've been very busy with the day job this month, and therefore finding new music has taken a backseat. Most of these were things were chosen/recommended by people who are not me, but I still think it represents a great snapshot of music released in March 2016. The Iggy Pop record in particular is excellent, and I don't think anyone was expecting him to ever make anything so good again. I'm also very pleased with my Rough Trade album of the month for March, which is the debut album by Unloved. It's difficult to categorise, but well worth a listen.

Unloved - _Guilty of Love_  
Iggy Pop - _Post Pop Depression_  
Primal Scream - _Chaosmosis_  
Richmond Fontaine - _You Can't Go Back If There's Nothing To Go Back To_  
The Range - _Potential_  
Underworld - _Barbara, Barbara, We Face An Uncertain Future_  
Max Richter - _Sleep (Remixes)_

I now own all but the last three on vinyl after a little splurge this week, and I don't think I've listened to much else this month.
