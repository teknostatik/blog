The holidays seem a long time ago, and I seem to have spent most of the last 2 months at work. But I still have vague memories (and many photographs) of an enjoyable week of walking and relaxing in Cornwall.

Next stop Japan, but not until September. In the meantime I may get round to writing up my "see more of Birmingham" experiment and (hopefully) seeing a fair bit of the jazz festival in July.
