This week I've been installing various things on the collection of SD cards and USB sticks I have lying around. Fedora 11 is looking very good, and runs like a dream on my EeePC. [TinyCore](http://www.tinycorelinux.com/) looks interesting, and boots in about 10 seconds, but I don't think it's what I'm looking for other than as a curiosity. [SystemRescueCD](http://www.sysresccd.org/Main_Page) looks useful, and pretty much does what it says on the tin.  
  
I'm keeping all three for now, although I still need to make an installable version of Ubuntu 9.04 at some point this week.  
  
And now to prepare for another day involving more people than computers.
