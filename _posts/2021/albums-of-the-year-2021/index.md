What can I say about 2021 that has not already been said? It has been another very challenging year; both for the world in general but also for the world of music. I have not experienced live music at all this year, but made up for it by buying a lot of records (and tried to buy them directly from the artists where possible, because people need to make a living). Music has always been very important to me, but never more so than now. These are the records that made this year better, or at least acted as a soundtrack to the bad bits.

## Top 20

In all cases the links below are to somewhere you can listen to and/or buy the record in question (Bandcamp, Rough Trade or the artist's own website).

### Arab Strap - [_As Days Get Dark_](https://arabstrapband.bandcamp.com/album/as-days-get-dark)

This is a record I never expected to be made, and it's been a real treat to listen to. It might even be my favourite Arab Strap record now. If you've not heard them before then you're in for a treat; if you've not heard them for ages then you won't be disappointed.

### Black Country, New Road - [_For the First Time_](https://blackcountrynewroad.bandcamp.com/album/for-the-first-time)

February saw the very welcome arrival of _For The First Time_ by Black Country, New Road. I had already played a lot of these songs to death, but getting them all in one place was exactly what I needed to shed some truth and light on the cold winter days. I think this is probably my record of the year, and it was always going to take something really special to dislodge it. It also came with a badge (more records should come with badges).

### Bobby Gillespie & Jehnny Beth - [_Utopian Ashes_](https://bobbyjehnny.bandcamp.com/album/utopian-ashes)

I've loved this record since the first time I heard it. It's got the emotional vibe of The National's Trouble Will Find Me, but also reminds me a lot of the Isobel Campbell & Mark Lanegan records. One I think I will keep coming back to. Some of these songs are uncomfortable, but it's because they stir the emotions in the way that all good songs should. For a record released in 2021 it sounds remarkably timeless.

### Desire Marea - [_Desire_](https://desiremarea.bandcamp.com/album/desire)

I am not even sure how to describe this record, but it's right up there with anything else released this year. If you're in the Rough Trade Club you will know this, for everyone else it may be a new treat.

### Dry Cleaning - [_New Long Leg_](https://drycleaning.bandcamp.com/album/new-long-leg)

April bought with it the excellent _New Long Leg_ by Dry Cleaning. It reminds me a bit of a cross between The Blue Aeroplanes and Arab Strap, but with female vocals. If that sounds intriguing then you should definitely give it a listen. The songs on the bonus CD are very good as well.

### Edward Ka-Spel - [_Prints of Darkness_](https://edwardka-spel.bandcamp.com/album/prints-of-darkness)

Edward Ka-Spel has released a lot of music this year. This one is probably the highlight (although I love them all, and they are all in my long-list). If you are not already bought into the Legendary Pink Dots ecosystem then this is as good a place as any to start, although it is one of the few records from this year's batch that isn't pay-what-you-want.

### Field Music - [_Flat White Moon_](https://fieldmusic.bandcamp.com/album/flat-white-moon)

Field Music never fail to deliver, and this record is no exception. Once more they manage to create a sound that is unmistakeably _them_, and that is very difficult to describe or assign a genre to. If you know their work then you know what I mean. If you don't then this is as good a place as any to start.

### Floating Points, Pharoah Sanders & The London Symphony Orchestra - [_Promises_](https://floatingpoints.bandcamp.com/album/promises)

This is the soundtrack to many hours of work this year, and a record I don't think I'll ever tire of. It's not a combination I would have expected to make a record, but it works _really_ well and hits the same emotional resonance as Talk Talk's _Laughing Stock_.

### For Those I Love - [For Those I Love](https://thoseilove.bandcamp.com/album/for-those-i-love-explicit)

A really unique record that builds well on the mixtape from last year (which would have been in my list if I had discovered it in time). I'm not sure I'm brave enough to try and match this to a genre, but if you take a leap of faith then you may find yourself spending many hours with this record.

### Gazelle Twin & NYX - [_Deep England_](https://nyx-edc.bandcamp.com/album/deep-england)

I'm not sure how to describe this record by Gazelle Twin & NYX, but I've played it a lot this year, and it's definitely a contender. I would really love to hear this live in a candlelit church; it's the kind of music that would work so well in that kind of environment.

### Geese - [_Projector_](https://geesebandnyc.bandcamp.com/album/projector)

A last minute entry that I have largely listened to as I am compiling this list. I discovered Geese via a Rough Trade 7" single, and was very happy to receive this earlier this month. It is definitely a grower, but one that will stay with me well into 2022.

### Jane Weaver - [_Flock_](https://janeweaverfire.bandcamp.com/album/flock)

Many people may not have heard of Jane Weaver, but this record is a joyous pop masterpiece that I think anyone who appreciates good music would enjoy. This is what pop music should sound like in 2021.

### Maximo Park - [_Nature Always Wins_](https://www.maximopark.com/)

I was going to say that this is surprisingly good, but it's not really a surprise any more. Definitely their strongest record for a while, and one that I keep coming back to.

### Mogwai - [_As the Love Continues_](https://mogwai.bandcamp.com/album/as-the-love-continues)

Mogwai are a really important band for me, and have been one of the main soundtracks of my year of working from home. I often listen to them when I'm working. The tracks with obvious vocals are when I take a break and just listen to the words for a few minutes. Richie Sacramento is my "take a break" track, and it's amusing that it is also one of my most played songs of this year (maybe I took too many breaks?).

At the time I said "I think if this gets to number 1 tomorrow then it's the first time since _Kid A_ that something that completely represents my musical taste at the time does that." It did get to number one, and it was a very satisfying feeling.

### Penfriend - [_Exotic Monsters_](https://penfriend.rocks/exoticmonsters)

I used to be the kind of person who thought that title tracks should go at the end (I blame Robert Smith for this). Here we have a title track that belongs at the start, followed by a collection of songs that I've been lucky enough to hear as they have been evolving, and also now they have been released.

One of the many things I love about Penfriend is the quality of the things I get through the post. Coloured vinyl, postcards, badges, stickers; all the things I loved about collecting records as a teenager. This record really is the complete package, and highlights some of the brilliant work Laura has been doing over the last couple of years (along with [the podcast](https://penfriend.rocks/podcast), [the YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/penfriendrocks) and everything else).

### Richard Dawson & Circle - [_Henki_](https://richardmichaeldawson.bandcamp.com/album/henki)

Richard Dawson does it again. A fantastic and flawless concept album that I love more each time I listen to it. It snuck into the list right at the end of the year, but it's something I suspect will be listened to a lot during the first few months of 2022.

### Snapped Ankles - [_Forest of Your Problems_](https://shop.snappedankles.com/album/forest-of-your-problems)

One step on from their last record. I love it. I also really wish I could see them play live again, because my first experience was absolutely mind-blowing.

### Squid - [_Bright Green Field_](https://squiduk.bandcamp.com/album/bright-green-field)

May's Rough Trade album of the month was _Bright Green Field_ by Squid. A new name for me, but one that reminds me a little of Black Country, New Road and a lot of other things that I really like. It's not an easy first listen, but it soon makes itself indispensable and is another one that was always going to feature on my end of year list.

### The Stranglers - [_Dark Matters_](https://stranglers.tmstor.es/product/79628)

I did not expect this record to be so good, and it's a fitting tribute to Dave Greenfield who we lost this year. I think it's probably their best since their heyday.

### Wolf Alice - [_Blue Weekend_](https://store.wolfalice.co.uk/collections/music/products/blue-weekend-vinyl)

Maybe a predictable choice, but I do really love this record, and I think it will stand the test of time. This sounds the way I expect number one records in 2021 to sound like.
