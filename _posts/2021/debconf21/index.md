I've managed to attend a lot of the talks at [Debconf21](https://debconf21.debconf.org/). This was also true of [Debconf20](https://debconf20.debconf.org), but I very much feel like I've understood a _lot_ more of what is being talked about this time, and I'm also very happy that I was sent a conference T-shirt and badge so I can participate fully in the experience.

Talks I've attended (with hyperlinks to the video of the talk if they currently exist) are:

Videos of all the talks I missed are [also available](https://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2021/DebConf21/) so there is plenty for me to watch during my long holiday-at-home that starts in less than a week.

It's interesting to see the different presentation styles as well as the content they are delivering, and I hope I've also learned a bit more about what works and what doesn't when presenting content to a virtual audience.

I'm not sure I would attend a physical Debconf unless I was a little more involved with the project, but I've certainly enjoyed doing it virtually this year.
