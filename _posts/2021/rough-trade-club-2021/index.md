I've been subscribed to the [Rough Trade Club](https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/membership) for a few years now, and receive a monthly record with a few other interesting bits of paraphernalia thrown in. The records I get are rarely bad, and many of them are things I would buy anyway, but the selection this year has been particularly strong, and If I had to only listen to these records for a whole year then I think I would be OK.

January's selection was _Welfare Jazz_ by Viagra Boys. I loved their last record and this one is also very strong. It fuses together quite a few genres of music, but it's also immediately accessible and a lot of fun as well.

February saw the very welcome arrival of _For The First Time_ by Black Country, New Road. I had already played a lot of these songs to death, but getting them all in one place was exactly what I needed to shed some truth and light on the cold winter days. I think this is still my record of the year (so far), and it will take something really special to dislodge it. It also came with a badge (more records should come with badges).

March's record was _Flock_ by Jane Weaver. An artist I already own music by, and another record that was already on my list to buy. Many people may not have heard of Jane Weaver, but this record is a joyous pop masterpiece that I think anyone who appreciates good music would enjoy. It was also the subject of a really entertaining listening party.

April bought with it the excellent _New Long Leg_ by Dry Cleaning. It reminds me a bit of a cross between The Blue Aeroplanes and Arab Strap, but with female vocals. If that sounds intriguing then you should definitely give it a listen. The songs on the bonus CD are very good as well.

May's record was _Bright Green Field_ by Squid. A new name for me, but one that reminds me a little of Black Country, New Road and a lot of other things that I really like. It's not an easy first listen, but it soon makes itself indispensable and is another one that will definitely feature on my end of year list.

I've also chosen to buy music by Arab Strap, Mogwai, Maximo Park and Field Music, all of which I've very much recommend, but it is the Rough Trade selection that I think best represent the musical journey I've been on so far this year.
