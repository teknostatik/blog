Last night I was experimenting with [ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/) as a way of easily launching apps on my computer. After using it for a few hours it seems like something that I _might_ want to start using all the time, but it also made me start looking at other launchers like [Albert](https://albertlauncher.github.io/) which seems a little harder to install but which promises to search across my applications, my local files, and the internet.

I think that as I try and use a keyboard for most things this is the sort of application I need. At the moment I'm using [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) which does the job well enough but which is also quite basic and relies me to choose between knowing the package name _or_ the name that would be displayed if I was using it in a more traditional menu (so `files` or `naultilus` but not both). The launchers I'm looking at now do both of these and more, but both of them require a little hoop-jumping to get them installed so may not be suitable for my default installation image (although there is at least [a PPA for ulauncher](https://launchpad.net/~agornostal/+archive/ubuntu/ulauncher) so I may very well have a go at getting that added this afternoon)

It's something I'll come back to, but in the meantime it's always fun trying out new software that may one day become part of my workflow.
