I've been to a couple of very enjoyable concerts this year (Belle & Sebastian and She Makes War) and I'd very much like to go to more now the nights are drawing in and spending evenings outside is less appealing. I thought it was worth listing things I was interested in, just in case I know anyone who might want to come along.

All of these are in Birmingham, and I in no way intend to go to all of them (but some would be nice).
