I have all sorts of things planned this Christmas, some of which may happen and some of which may take a little longer to reach fruition.

- Albums of the year (which I always do), and which will be ready on or around 31st December.
- One movie a day, where I will watch one decent movie a day, and list them all with a few notes on why I chose them and how they all fit together.
- A writing project, which I've started, and which might end up being a "one poem a day" type exercise.

It is good to have some time to work on this sort of thing, and I'm hopeful it will redress the balance a little after a year of too much work, too much responsibility and not enough creativity.
