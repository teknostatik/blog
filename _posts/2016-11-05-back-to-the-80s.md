Yesterday appeared to be 1980s day. I created a playlist the day before called _rediscoveries_ and listened to it for most of the day (with a brief break to listen to Hope Sandoval's new record on vinyl). I can't remember the last time I listened to Tears for Fears, OMD, Ultravox, Japan, Simple Minds, Furniture and The Associates, but it's the sort of music that takes me back to childhood the moment I hear it. Other things from this era have stuck with me in the years that followed, but there is quite a lot about the 1980s that I very much left _in_ the 1980s, as I left home, moved to a new city, and reinvented myself in the way people do when they go to University. Maybe in a few years time I'll be ready to revisit the 1990s through a filter of nostalgia, but for now I'm content with enjoying music that sounded dated 20 years ago but that now sounds surprisingly contemporary.
