I'm always looking for new ways to make web content available easily, and [Pancake](https://pancake.io/) is one of the best (and easiest) I've found.

The basic concept is that the application creates a directory in Dropbox, and anything in that directory is hosted as a website. It can handle Markdown, HTMl, plain text and a few other things as well, and has a decent default CSS that makes it easy to get a decent looking website online without having to code anything. There is also a web-based editor which looks useful.

I've made a few web pages using this technology, all of which have been written in Markdown using [Atom](https://atom.io/) as a text editor. So far I've created [a basic home page](http://teknostatik.pancakeapps.com/), [an example of a blog post](http://teknostatik.pancakeapps.com/it_literacy.md) (using content copied from this blog), and [a page I made](http://teknostatik.pancakeapps.com/now) as part of the [/now](http://nownownow.com/) movement.

It's straightforward to do, and all you really need is a [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) account.
