I think I'm getting better at showing people things I've written. I used to be terrible at this; and at one point must have had hundreds of pages of writing that I had never shared with another person.

This is largely not the case now. There are things I've written all over the internet, I have three pieces of writing about to be published on a new MBTI themed website due soon, and I'm a lot more comfortable with showing people things I've written; including things I've had kicking around in some form or another for years.

There's only really one way to become a writer, and that's to write. And part of writing is showing your writing to other people, listening to feedback, and taking that feedback on board to become a _better_ writer.

I'm hoping to have time to sit down and write _something_ for this blog while I'm overseas next week, but in the meantime, I'll dig out a couple of things I've written over the last few weeks that I've not yet got around to posting.
