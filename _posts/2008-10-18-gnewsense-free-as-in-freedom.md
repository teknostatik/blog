I was sceptical that a Linux distribution with no proprietary components at all would do everything I need it to. But 30 minutes after burning the CD, I've got a pretty desktop, a working wireless connection, and what seems like quite a fast and user-friendly interface.

gNewSense can be downloaded from [http://www.gnewsense.org/](http://www.gnewsense.org/)
