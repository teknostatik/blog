It's been another good week for new music. I try and listen to a few new things every Friday whilst working, and this is the selection I chose yesterday:

* [Bleed](https://thenecksau.bandcamp.com/album/bleed) by The Necks
* [Totally Fine](https://theeurosuite.bandcamp.com/album/totally-fine) by The Eurosuite
* [Fate & Alcohol](https://japandroids.bandcamp.com/album/fate-alcohol) by Japandroids

I'm already familiar with all three artists, but it's always good to hear new music from old favourites.
