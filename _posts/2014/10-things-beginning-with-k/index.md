_This is another old post that never quite made it here. Itâ€™s probably about 3 years old at least, and is a response to a meme where I had to choose 10 things beginning with the same letter and write about them._

1\. Knowledge. I've always liked to know things, and to learn as much as I possibly can about any subject which holds my interest. I have quite a few odd specialist knowledges, and I would like to hope that I will never stop learning new things.

2\. Kafkaesque. Not only is it a great word, but it also reminds me of the time when I started ready properly, and devoured everything Kafka had ever written in a period of a couple of weeks.

3\. Ka. In Ancient Egypt the supposed spiritual part of an individual human being or god, which survived (with the soul) after death and could reside in a statue of the person. This word (and many other words) reminds me of how much obscure Egyptology knowledge I have squirrelled away (despite never actually having studied it formally), and I remember being fascinated by the Egyptian concept of souls as a small child.

4\. Kismet. A tricky one to explain, so I'll go with the dictionary definition first "_fate, destiny, fortune, providence, the stars, God's will, what is written in the stars, one's doom, one's portion, one's lot, one's lot in life, karma, predestination, pre-ordination, predetermination, what is to come, the writing on the wall; luck, chance_". The idea of fate, destiny, and free will fascinate me, and probably also crop up a fair bit in things I write.

5\. Kings and Queens. I was the strange child who learned the names of all the Kings and Queens of England and Scotland and could recite them in order and come up with random facts about each one. I probably still have this knowledge somewhere, but it may have now been replaced with other things.

6\. Karma. Ties in with Kismet a little, and is just one of those words I like the sound of.

7\. Kurt Wagner - Lead singer of Lambchop, who are a band I've liked for many years and always keep coming back to. I love the fact that at the height of their popularity he still worked sanding floors, and he's always struck me as a totally down to earth bloke who just happens to make very good music.

8\. Kid A. My favourite Radiohead album, which takes me back to my early days of working for the University where I had a lot less money but still somehow managed to buy more music and travel more. I like it when a band takes their sound in a new direction and takes their fans with them, and I think this record is a classic example of how to do it well.

9\. Knives Don't Have Your Back. And for my final musical choice, the (as yet) only solo album by Emily Haines of Metric. There are some days where this is the only record that makes sense for reasons I'm not sure I can articulate except to say that it is a thing of beauty.

10\. Keys. My keys are one thing I always know the physical location of. They get me into my house and my office, and act as a sort of symbol of having a home, having a job and having responsibilities. I sort of like the idea of biometric keys, but I'm not sure it would be quite the same.
