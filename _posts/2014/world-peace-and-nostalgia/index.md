The new Morrissey album reminds me how much both Morrissey and The Smiths played a huge part in my musical upbringing. The Smiths were probably the first band who meant something to me at school, and while Morrissey has made a few substandard records, the new one is great, and is in fact the 4th consecutive album of his that I've loved, which hasn't happened since The Smiths.

I've read two reviews that pretty much say what I want to say. [The first is from The Quietus](http://thequietus.com/articles/15752-morrissey-world-peace-is-none-of-your-business-review), [the second is written by Luke Haines](http://music.thetalkhouse.com/talks/3191/), another singer I'm a big fan of.
