I should probably write proper reviews of some of these, but for now I will just make a list.

Ken McClure - The Secret Adrian Barnes - Nod Anne Oâ€™Brien - The Virgin Widow Donna Tartt - The Goldfinch Jon Ronson - The Psychopath Test Scott Stossel - My Age of Anxiety

I also made [a Spotify playlist](http://open.spotify.com/user/teknostatik/playlist/3quuLeDGhI99LFJQknYRmu "2014 Music") of music released this year, to help me remember what I've listened to.
