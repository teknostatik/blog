I've now (finally) got two-way [OpenID](http://openid.net/) support built into this installation of wordpress. What this means is:

- I can log into sites like Livejournal using my account from teknostatik.co.uk. Not that useful, but fairly impressive.
- Anyone who has an account with Livejournal, or a Gmail account, or one of a number of other things can leave comments on this blog.

Of course, I didn't fix this today, I'm just catching up on writing documentation and blog posts while I'm off sick with face-ache.
