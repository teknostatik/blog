One of the last social things I did before lockdown was the 6 Music Festival (and an excellent non-festival Jehnny Beth concert that is probably the musical highlight of my year so far). I've been trying to do more live music (combined with cycling adventures) and this sort of event really works for me as it takes me to a different city and builds in enough time to properly explore.

Obviously more adventures of this type are not possible now, but over the last week I've been participating in Tim Burgess' [Twitter listening parties](https://timstwitterlisteningparty.com/index.html) where people all listen to the same record at the same time, and the people who made the record in the first place commentate. I've never consumed music in quite this way before, but I now think it's something I'd like to continue doing after lockdown. I've rediscovered some old music that required hunting down CDs and MP3 backups, connected with people who share my love of some of my current favourites, and generally added a bit of structure to my evenings.

This is my calendar for this week. I've been off work so I've had a lot of free time, but even next week I think I'll tune in for a few as well as nothing actually eats into work time.

My new social life

I know this is making things easier for a lot of people, and also that this is introducing people to new music that they can buy, and thus support the artists who are really struggling right now without the revenue from gigs. It's a good thing, and I'm glad I'm part of it.
