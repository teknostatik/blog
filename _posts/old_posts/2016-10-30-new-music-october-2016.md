Music I've discovered in October includes:

Kate Tempest - _Let Them Eat Chaos_  
Conor Oberst - _Ruminations_  
D.D Dumbo - _Utopia Defeated_  
R.M Hubbert - _Telling The Trees_  
Lady Gaga - _Joanne_  
Leonard Cohen - _You Want It Darker_  
SURVIVE - _RR7347_  
Danny Brown - _Atrocity Exhibition_  
Banks - _The Alter_  
Amanda Palmer - _Piano is Evil_  
Goat - _Requiem_  
Mac Miller - _The Divine Feminine_

I blame _American Horror Story_ for my love of the Lady Gaga album, and _Stranger Things_ for the discovery of SURVIVE. In fact, there is a lot of overlap between the music I've listened to and what I've watched on TV this month, with Kate Tempest and Danny Brown being a good soundtrack to _Luke Cage_ and the new Goat album complementing _American Horror Story_ quite nicely.
