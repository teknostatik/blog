15 albums in 15 minutes is what I'm aiming for here. I think the idea is to pick the 15 albums that define me and have stayed with me through the years, but I have a feeling this is going to concentrate on my late teens/early 20s more than it probably should.  
  
So here goes...  

1. Lloyd Cole and the Commotions - Mainstream
2. Sonic Youth - Daydream Nation
3. The Cure - Disintegration
4. Pixies - Surfer Rosa
5. Pixies - Doolittle
6. Joy Division - Closer
7. The Stone Roses - The Stone Roses
8. Rage Against the Machine - Rage Against the Machine
9. R.E.M - Automatic for the People
10. Manic Street Preachers - Gold Against the Soul
11. Manic Street Preachers - The Holy Bible
12. Jim O'Rourke - Bad Timing
13. The Beta Band - The Three EPs
14. Radiohead - Kid A
15. The Arcade Fire - Funeral

I could easily name another 15, and may very well change my mind on a lot of these by tomorrow.
