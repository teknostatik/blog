It's national album day, and as is traditional I've spent today playing some records that mean a lot to me, and also some that are new. This is today's selection.

- Richard Dawson - _2020_ (2019)
- Kim Gordon - _No Home Record_ (2019)
- Big Thief - _Two Hands_ (2019)
- Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds - _Ghosteen_ (2019)
- Black Francis/Frank Black - _Frank Black Francis_ (2004)
- The Flaming Lips - _Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots_ (2002)
- Radiohead - _Kid A_ (2000)
- Big Thief - _Capacity_ (2017)
- DIIV - _Deceiver_ (2019)
- Belle & Sebastian - _Days of the Bagnold Summer_ (2019)
- Kate Tempest - _The Book of Traps and Lessons_ (2019)
- Nick Drake - _Bryter Layter_ (1970)
- Julian Cope - _Skellington 3_ (2018)
- Nick Drake - _Pink Moon_ (1971)

It's all different than [last year](https://andy.teknostatik.co.uk/blog/2018/10/13/my-national-album-day-playlist/) but there is a lot on that list that I wish I'd had the time to play today.
