I was going to wait to review this until Sunday, but as I've listened to it a fair few times over the last 24 hours I thought it was worth sharing.

[Window Sills by The Wind Whistles](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/20549) - They think they sound like the Violent Femmes and the Lemonheads. Other people compare them with The Decemberists and the Moldy Peaches. I'd agree with all the above and add the White Stripes and the Fiery Furnaces to the mix.

The music has a traditional edge, but deals with modern (yet universal) subjects. Both singers can sing, and it sounds like they would be amazing in a live setting (anywhere from a concert hall to a camp fire).

I think I've just found my "walking to work" record for the next few days.
