I'm currently in York, staying in a very nice hotel for three days. I like this hotel because it provides free wifi and enough tea and coffee to get me through an average week. These things are important, and I think I probably judge hotels quite a lot on their ability to provide me with the facilities I actually need, as opposed to ironing boards and hair dryers and things I generally just don't use.  
  
So yes, this hotel seems to tick all the boxes. I've often said I could easily live in a hotel room if there was a decent net connection and easy access to food. This is the sort of place I mean.
