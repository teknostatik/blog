At various points in the last few days I've been fairly convinced that I'm ill. I've had a sore throat, various wheezing fits, and a general sense of tiredness that sleep does not fix.Â  The annoying thing is that each "episode" only lasts a few hours and then I feel fine again. Maybe it's my super-immune system kicking in, or maybe I just need a holiday and I'm not ill at all.  
  
In other (more relevant) news, I've been losing myself in the new Flaming Lips album for days. It's epic (over an hour and a half if you download the iTunes version), and a very challenging listen, but if you like music that makes you think and that is a little (lot) to the left of the mainstream then I'd very much recommend it. I'm also liking the new Califone album (for those times when I need to be soothed rather than challenged), but have otherwise not bought a great deal of new music recently.  
  
Of course, by "recently" I mean this month.
