Every few months I like to change my working area around, and try undertaking familiar tasks in a new way. Having a new office has intensified this, and has lead to me re-evaluating my working area at home as well.

And once again I seem to have settled on a very similar setup in each. I've not got photographs of my desk at work, but I have taken a couple of pictures of my desk at home, which should demonstrate what I mean.

And yes, I gave up on KDE4 after a few hours. While I'm more than happy to bounce between several different operating systems, I do have very definite preferences regarding how each one should look.
