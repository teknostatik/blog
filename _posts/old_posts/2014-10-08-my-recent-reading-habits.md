Over the last couple of months I've been reading _The Nearly Complete Works of Donald Harington_, which is a three volume collection that I downloaded from Amazon for 99p per volume (while they were on offer - they are slightly more now, but still very reasonably priced). I'd not read any of Harington's novels before, but I had heard good things about them, and so thought I'd wade in at the deep end.

I'm still only on volume 2, but apart from three other short books I've read nothing else for the last couple of months. I've enjoyed every page a great deal, and was actually expecting stand alone novels, rather than series of books that formed a definite chronology. Everything I've read so far has been set in or near a place called Stay More, and I would strongly recommend reading these books in the order they were written, and persevering with all of them, even those that seems unconnected or difficult at first.

The books I've read so far are:

Lightning Bug Some Other Place. The Right Place. The Architecture of the Arkansas Ozarks The Cockroaches of Stay More The Choiring of the Trees Ekaterina Butterfly Weed When Angels Rest Thirteen Albatrosses (or, Falling off the Mountain)
