I think I might have already written about [Mozilla Weave](https://mozillalabs.com/weave/), but as there is a new version out today I think it warrants a mention. Weave does one small thing, but does it very well. That small thing is that it takes your preferences, history, bookmarks, tabs and saved passwords (if you have saved passwords) and syncs them with other instances of Firefox. I find this invaluable, as I often hop between my main workstation and my netbook, and it basically lets me bookmark things for later and have them show up on all my computers. Between this and [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), I pretty much have access to everything important wherever I am, which helps with productivity, and ensures (theoretically) that I don't forget things.
