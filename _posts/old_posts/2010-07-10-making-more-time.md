Over the last few weeks, I've found myself running out of quality time to do things. It's not that I don't have enough time as such, it's just that when I get to the point in the day where I've done everything I _have_ to do, I find myself with very little energy to do the things I _want_ to do.  
  
This state of events does not surprise me. Every area of my life is at least as busy as I would like it to be, with some areas taking more time than they really deserve. And I actually think the fact that I'm fairly good at work-life balance is contributing towards my general feeling of not having enough time. As work gets busier, I think I subconsciously try and take on more outside of work to maintain the balance and the level of productivity I'm currently at. And while this is great in the short term, I think I hit the point last night where I realised I just didn't have any energy left to devote to _anything_ (be it work or non-work), and that what I really needed was to spend some time somewhere isolated and uncluttered to recharge my batteries.  
  
I plan on doing very little this weekend, which should help a great deal, although I'm already feeling hot and sticky and it's not even 9am.
