For a couple of years in the late 90's, I couldn't really afford to buy new music, and lived a fair distance away from any decent record stores. I think it's probably the only time in my life when I've felt totally disconnected from the world.‚Äè  
  
These days, thanks to the wonders of the internet, it's possible to listen to new music every day without spending a penny, although thankfully I'm now in a position where I can justify a 50 song a month emusic subscription and can buy a few other bits and pieces of music each month without it really impacting on my standard of living.  
  
I'm not sure if this makes me feel more connected, but it certainly makes me happier.  
  
This week I'm listening to a lot of music released on the [Captured Tracks](http://www.capturedtracks.com/) label. They don't release music on CDs, only on vinyl, cassette and digitally, and they remind me a lot of how Creation and Cherry Red were in the 80's. They also are home to Wild Nothing and Veronica Falls, who are two of the groups I'm listening to a lot at present.  
  
I've also recently discovered The Love Language, and am also very much enjoying the new albums by The Arcade Fire and Isobel Campbell and Mark Lanegan. I am also not yet anywhere near bored of the Indelicates album, and there is another one on the way soon as well.  
  
2010 has been a good year for music, and promises a few more interesting releases in the autumn.
