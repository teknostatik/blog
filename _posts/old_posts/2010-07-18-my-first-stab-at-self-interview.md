In my last post I mentioned [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/ "What do people use to get the job done?"). This is my attempt to answer the questions.

**Who are you and what do you do?**

I'm [Andy](http://teknostatik.co.uk "My blog"), and I work for IT Services at the [University of Birmingham](http://www.bham.ac.uk "University of Birmingham - it's a great place to work") in a Service Desk management/development role. In my spare time I listen to and write about music, dabble in free and open source software (mainly [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com "A free and open source operating system")), and am sporadically involved in the [Isles of Darkness](http://www.islesofdarkness.com "IoD - a community of people who happen to be roleplayers") live action roleplay society.

**What hardware are you using?**

At work everything is largely generic. I have a Dell desktop that is coming to the end of its life, but that is still more than capable of dealing with most of my emailing and calendaring needs. It is plugged into a 17" Sony monitor that has been with me for about 4 years now, and which I keep holding on to as it is one of the few desktop monitors I've used that doesn't give me a headache after hours of staring at it (yes, I know a new monitor and more breaks might be a more sensible plan).

Most of my actual work is done on an (again) fairly generic Fujitsu Siemens laptop, which I started using a couple of years ago, and which allows me to type for hours without my wrists hurting. I wouldn't recommend this laptop above any other, but it does the job.

At home I have pretty much left desktop computers behind. My main workstation is a Sony Vaio VGN-NS10l (dual core, 4Gb ram), which I bought a couple of years ago and deals with anything I throw at it. I've also got a [10" Dell Inspiron Mini](http://www1.euro.dell.com/uk/en/home/Laptops/inspiron-1012/pd.aspx?refid=inspiron-1012&s=dhs&cs=ukdhs1 "The Dell mini - the best small laptop I've ever used"), which goes everywhere with me, and is increasingly becoming the computer I do most of my web browsing, email and writing on. My backup machines are a [G4 iBook](http://www.apple.com/support/ibook/ "A 4 year old laptop that is faster than when I bought it") and a EeePC 701, and we've also got another Mac and a Wii plugged into the TV downstairs. My wife has several other computers which I'll not mention here except to say that we have more computers than there are rooms in our house (by quite a lot). And that's not counting the ones that are propping open doors or otherwise not really being used for anything productive any longer.

**And what software?**

Work is a mix of Windows XP (desktop) and Ubuntu 10.04 (laptop). In Windows I largely use Outlook for email and calendaring, [office communicator](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/communicator/ "I hate what this represents, but it is useful") for collaboration, and very little else. In Linux I use [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com "Firefox - every computer needs it") for browsing (with [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome "Chrome - faster than firefox, but I'm not quite convinced as yet") and [Epiphany](http://projects.gnome.org/epiphany/ "Epiphany - the Gnome web browser") for testing), [Evolution](http://projects.gnome.org/evolution/ "Evolution - full fat, but fully functional") for email, [Empathy](http://live.gnome.org/Empathy "My current favourite IM client") and [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/ "One day this website will save your life") for collaboration, [OpenOffice.org](http://www.openoffice.org "Better (and faster) than ever") for creating documents and spreadsheets, and (generally) [Bluefish](http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/ "What you see is what you need") for coding. Recently I've been using [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/ "It's a steep learning curve but I think I'm getting there") a lot too, and have also been dabbling with a few command-line image conversion tools. I also maintain several instances of [Mediawiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki "Still my favourite wiki software"), as well as a full [LAMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29 "Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP") environment for development, and use [google calendar](http://calendar.google.com "This is where I plan my life") to plan and maintain my work-life balance.

At home both of my laptops are running the latest version of [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com "Purple is the new brown"), which I've used as my primary OS since 2005. I use largely the same software as I use at work, although I've recently reverted to using [gedit](http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/ "A lightweight text editor") for writing blog posts and other bits of text, and only venturing into OpenOffice when I want to make something available to other people. Home is also where I spend a lot of time playing with [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org "I still roll my own, although it is now mirrored at wordpress.com") and [Virtualbox](http://www.virtualbox.org/ "This is why I only use 3 computers and not 10"), and where I use [Rhythmbox](http://projects.gnome.org/rhythmbox/ "The Gnome music player") to listen to music (and [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/teknostatik "Stalk me on last.fm") to catalogue what I'm listening to). I've also recently started using [Google Reader](http://reader.google.com "Everything, all in one place"), and I now don't know how I coped without it.

My Macs run a very stripped down version of [Leopard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Leopard "No Snow Leopard for my old macs"), and really only get used for [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/uk/itunes/ "My guilty secret") and other media related things now (although I'd still use my iBook as my main portable computer if it weighed a little less). They also run Dropbox (as does every computer I own), and I've been syncing all my important files between all my machines for a couple of years now. I still can't understand why more people don't do this, and I've lost count of the number of times this one piece of software has got me out of a hole.

**What would be your dream setup?**

I change my mind about my ideal working environment a lot, but what I basically want is a laptop that is thin, light and stylish, and that can perform at the level where I could use it as my only computer (including storing 100gb of music). The nearest thing I’ve come across is the 13″ [Macbook Pro](http://www.apple.com/uk/macbookpro/ "Always on my wish list"), although I’d be happier with something the size and weight of my 10″ Dell Mini with all the power and stylishness of the Macbook Pro. Being able to run OS X and Ubuntu at the same time would also be great.

Of course, having used an [iPad](http://www.apple.com/uk/ipad/ "I could grow to love this") for the first time recently, I'd probably have to add that to my wish list, just because it's a really stylish and functional piece of kit.

I also wonder if having a desktop computer with two large monitors would make me more productive. I have a feeling that most of what I do can be achieved on a single small screen, but it would be nice to have the opportunity to experiment with these things.
