I woke up yesterday feeling less than well, but soon made the decision that it was not going to stop me from interacting fully in the activities of the day. After breakfast we caught a tram, and then a bus, which took us through some fairly impressive scenery including cloud-shrouded mountains and the bluest of seas. The journey did not take too long (nothing does here - it's just over an hour from one end of the island to the other), and we soon found ourselves in Puerto de la Cruz, which is in the north of Tenerife and is significantly more tourist focused than Santa Cruz. The differences could not have been more obvious - from the English translations on menus and street signs, to the amount of merchandise for sale in the shops and stalls that are _everywhere_. The day largely consisted of walking around and taking [photographs](https://twitter.com/teknostatik/status/870011008214982658) (mainly of [lizards](https://twitter.com/teknostatik/status/869869838281388033)\- there were many lizards), and also getting coffee and snacks in a couple of places (where again the slightly inflated prices suggested a focus towards temporary visitors).

Last night's film was Moana. I may have interacted with my iPad a fair bit during that one.
