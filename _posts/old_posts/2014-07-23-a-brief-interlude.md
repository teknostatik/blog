I was just flicking back through my historical blog posts for _reasons_. One thing that amused me is what I wrote at the end of my 2013 post celebrating our Green Impact campaign at work ([http://teknostatik.co.uk/2013/04/24/green-impact/](http://teknostatik.co.uk/2013/04/24/green-impact/)):

> _"Hopefully what we have done so far has made a difference, but we already have plans for the next twelve months to build on this good work and hopefully aim for a Gold Plus award this time next year."_

So it turns out I called it. Because we did actually win Gold Plus, which I completely failed to mention in this year’s post on a similar subject. Of course, that means there isn’t anywhere else to go next year other than to try and sustain this year’s effort. But I suppose that is a good sort of problem to have.

And good problems are my favourite kind of problems.
