I've been trying out [Suse Studio](http://susestudio.com/) over the last couple of days. It's a build service for livecds and software appliances, and it really is so easy to use that I think most non-technical users could get to grips with it. It's invite only at present, but I got an invite just by asking (and I'm not exactly known for my love of the distro).

I've built a 300mb livecd with a very minimalistic Gnome install plus Dropbox, and it seems to do everything I want it to do. And it only took about 20 minutes in total to do.

I think this is something I will play with some more when I'm on holiday.
