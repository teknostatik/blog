It's November, and like a lot of other people I'm attempting to write 50,000 words. At least 40,000 of those are going to be fiction (hopefully more), but I thought it was also worth trying to write down the _other_ things in my head - the things that don't really belong in a piece of fiction. I have no intention of posting them all here, but I thought a few fragments based on the sort of things I usually write in this blog wouldn't hurt.

Things I have done this week have involved writing, a small bit of housework, and a few hours in front of the TV (watching _Hemlock Grove_, a bit of _Once Upon a Time_ and all of _Mr. Robot_). The latter has some themes that are quite close to what I'm writing, which made me consider stopping what I was working on (I didn't). I also answered some questions (via email) for a website related to the [http://nownownow.com/](http://nownownow.com/) movement. I should probably update [my /now page](http://teknostatik.co.uk/now/) to say that answering questions about things like this is generally something I'm willing to do (I love being interviewed).

I'm listening a lot to old Cardiacs records this week. I've also found some complete concerts on YouTube which I'm enjoying very much.

My Rough Trade album of the month is [_Elaenia_ by Floating Points](http://www.roughtrade.com/albums/96992). I love it, and it sounds a lot better than the description. I like discovering new artists in this way, although I'm a little miffed that the vinyl version won't arrive until after I'm back at work, and will therefore involve a trip to the post office.

I'm now watching [this recording of the Masada String Trio from 1999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a95ODn5k_1c) - time to catch up on the hundreds of hours of concert footage I've downloaded from YouTube over the last few months. The software I use is called [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) (you can get it for Linux or OS X).

One day I'll get round to writing a blog post about my musical heroes; people I'll buy/listen to everything they have ever done. Joy Division/New Order, The Cure, British Sea Power, Cardiacs, Red House Painters/SunKil Moon, Jim O'Rourke and John Zorn. Maybe a few others as well, but these will probably have to be the main ones. I suspect this would be a very long piece of writing (10 pages +). I might want to talk about my teenage Felt fixation, and probably throw in a bit of House of Love/Wedding Present related writing as well. I also suspect people will realise exactly how much music I own if I write this post, and also how much some of it is worth (I have New Order and Cardiacs CDs/cassettes that I could sell for above £50 each right now).

Also a post about my vinyl buying experiments, and what you get for your £20 (which varies greatly depending on the artist/record company). Also some of them are a lot less than £20 now which pleases me (I'm waiting for my 1st sub-£10 record purchase in many years to arrive - a re-pressing of Joy Division's _Closer_).

I think John Grant wins the "what you get for your £20" competition right now. Double album, CD version included, plus a bonus CD and an insert containing a load of really nice artwork.

_Closer_ arrived, and it's gorgeous. An exact replica of the 1980 vinyl, with sound from the 2007 remaster. Best of both worlds. Ian Curtis hung himself just after making this record, but listening to it always fills me with hope.

* * *

I'm listening to Felt's _The Splendour of Fear_. One of the first records I ever bought, and something I love, but would probably never recommend to another human being. Six tracks, four of them instrumentals, clocking in a little over 30 minutes.

I am not sure I'm going to write anything today apart from this. The story I'm writing has hit a brick wall in that I've written a whole load of fragments, edited them together into three sections, and now I can see the narrative and chronology starting to form. I'm not sure what else to do though - it's not clear enough for other people to understand, and so many sections need fleshing out more and rewriting in a more descriptive style. I've also got whole chapters that are just dialogue - probably more dialogue than other people write. I think I've probably written something that needs to exist in a variety of formats - novel, poem, play, movie, interactive adventure. But I also think it's not original enough, and that I've managed to drag a few things into the chronology that I wasn't expecting (like the way it's turned out to be a Grail quest, like everything I write does, it seems).

My process for creating art (of any kind) is largely the same. Improvise fragments, juxtapose the fragments until their context to other fragments gives them meaning, and then take that as a starting point to flesh it out into a finished piece. It's what I do with music, and writing, and pretty much everything I create. The finished product is just a synthesis of distinct parts that work due to their proximity to other parts. Also known as "there is no perfect chord" (sorry Leonard).

I'm listening to the new Grimes album on Spotify. I've read a few reviews of this record, and thought I'd have to actually listen to it as the reviews are really not that helpful (in that no-one can agree whether it's a good record, whether they like it, what sort of music it's meant to be). I've only listened to it once, but my first impression is that I like it, I'll listen to it again, and that it's intelligent pop music that utilises a really varied sonic palate. It'a also on 4AD, who have a habit of never releasing bad records (I may be a little biased as many of my favourite musicians have some sort of link with 4AD). I think the [Quietus review](http://thequietus.com/articles/19212-grimes-art-angels-review) does the best job (as it often does), although some of the comments are horrible.

My [nownownow.com profile page](http://nownownow.com/p/teknostatik) went live last night. I should get round to writing something about this movement soon, because I think it's really important.
