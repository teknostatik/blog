By this time tomorrow I will have successfully implemented the support of Mac OS X in my workplace. It's been a long 14 month slog, but I've learned a lot about Macs, project management, and a fair few things beside. I've also lived pretty much wholly in Mac OS X since April 2011, which scared me at first but now feels oddly familiar.

Next up will be iOS and Linux. iOS is a new thing for me, but Linux certainly isn't, and it was quite soothing today to open up my Linux laptop and do my first bit of Ubuntu work for nearly a year. Â I've also (finally) given up Gnome 2, and after a brief dalliance with Gnome 3 have decided that Unity is the interface that I'll use on all my Linux machines from now on.

Not that I'm giving up my Macs though. Unity and OS X are actually quite similar in a lot of ways, and I see both of them featuring heavily in both my personal and professional future.
