What I want from my next netbook/small laptop:  

1. As much battery life as possible (I've heard 14 hours quotes is possible)
2. The ability to easily upgrade the memory to 4Gb
3. A keyboard and trackpad that I can learn to love as much as my current Dell Mini
4. A decent screen resolution, but a fairly small screen size
5. The ability to run either Mac OS X or some flavour of Linux on it  
    

I think I might be describing the 11" Macbook Air (which I can't justify buying, not even for work), but I probably should start thinking about a replacement for my Dell Mini as it's 2 years old, quite battered, and only lasts about 2.5 hours away from the charger.  
  
But in the meantime, for my upcoming trip to Edinburgh I'll be relying on the mini, a 50% share in the work Macbook Pro, plus possibly a loaned iPad (we're going to the [UCISA conference](http://www.ucisa.ac.uk/en/events/2011/conference2011.aspx) in Edinburgh and they seem keen to loan all sorts of tech out to delegates).
