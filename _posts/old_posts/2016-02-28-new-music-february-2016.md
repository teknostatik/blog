Lots of interesting music to showcase this month, including a Bowie tribute, a strong debut from Sunflower Bean and the second album from DIIV. I also can't get enough of the Yorkston/Thorne/Khan record after being introduced to it earlier this month, and I've found myself listening to a few of James Yorkston's earlier albums as well.

Sunflower Bean - _Human Ceremony_  
Jherek Bischoff and Amanda Palmer - _Strung Out In Heaven_ (not on Spotify playlist)  
Yorkston/Thorne/Khan - _Everything Sacred_  
Guy Blakeslee - _The Middle Sister_  
The Besnard Lakes _A Coliseum Complex Museum_  
DIIV - _Is This The Are_  
Wild Nothing - _Life of Pause_  
She Makes War - _Direction of Travel_ (not on Spotify playlist)
