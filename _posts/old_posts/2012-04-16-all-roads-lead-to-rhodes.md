I'm currently on holiday in Rhodes. I've just finished the 7th book I've read since I got here, and I'm really appreciating having the Kindle with me as it has quickly become an important part of the technology I carry with me when I travel. It's interesting to see what the other guests are using actually - there are a few laptops, lots of phones, but not much in the way of kindles or other ebook readers. A fair few people are accessing the internet from the hotel lobby, and it is certainly more socially acceptable to do so then it was a few years ago, although some older people still blatantly disapprove.Â There are also many many internet cafes in the general vicinity, and I get the feeling that although this is a sleepy tourist area it is also fairly well connected. The signal here is strong, and the speed is comparable to UK broadband.

I carry technology with me wherever I travel. I don't always take the full range of devices, but I generally have something to read, something to listen to music on, and some sort of communication device at the very least. I actually find that being able to access my books and my music relaxes me, and I do enjoy having internet access when I'm away as it allows me to research what the weather will be like, and what local customs I need to be aware of. On this trip I've limited my net access to one session a day (usually around an hour), but in that time I've researched what I need to research, as well as reading (if not replying to) all personal email and skimming through articles of interest from my growing list of RSS feeds. It interests me that this activity takes less than an hour a day, because when I'm at home it often takes significantly longer.
