I have so many things I want to write about right now. Starting with some of the really productive conversations I've been having with staff and students about how they use IT, and ending with everything I've learned over the last few days at the UCISA conference in Edinburgh. I reckon that's probably at least a few thousand words of writing, but as I've got a few other things to get finished first, I thought I'd at least make a list for my own benefit.

1. The move towards phones and tablets and away from traditional computers, and what this means for service delivery and support.
2. Why job descriptions, job titles, and what we actually DO at work should be as closely aligned as possible.
3. Balancing innovation and stability.
4. Google Apps, live@edu, and email for life.

I think that covers most of it for now.
