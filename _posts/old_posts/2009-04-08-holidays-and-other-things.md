As of 4pm tomorrow I'm on holiday for 10 days. It's the first break of any length I've had for a few weeks, and I am very much looking forward to it. Last time I was off I ended up spending most of the week working on various projects, but I do intend to make at least a half hearted effort to step away from my laptop for a few hours each day and actually enjoy the sunshine.  
  
I will also review some music, seeing as I've actually been asked to by some of the people who make it (which still scares me).  
  
Of course, it would be a good time to upgrade all the computers to Ubuntu 9.04, but I think I may wait a couple of weeks for that.
