So yes, it's the yearly evening to sit in front of the TV and encounter more dreadful music than I do in the rest of the year put together. I do like the Eurovison song contest though, although not for the reasons I like other music (any other music). It's cheesy, it's dreadful, but it also makes me laugh and makes me glad that for the rest of the year I get to listen to music that actually says something to me.

I may also be abusing twitter a lot tonight. Check out [#eurovision](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23eurovision) for live commentary.
