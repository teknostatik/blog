We are now in New York.

Wednesday was a very long day. We got up at 3:30am UK time, and didn't arrive at our hotel until the sort of time we would normally be thinking of going to bed. Despite this, we went to Starbucks for a coffee (there are no coffee making facilities in our room), and then wandered to Times Square to look at the pretty lights and generally marvel at how big and alive everything feels. We then went to the restaurant next to our hotel to grab food and drink before getting a stupidly early night (8pm NY time, which felt like 1am).

Thursday (Christmas Eve) involved a lot of shopping (or rather wandering around shops and not buying a lot). We also saw lots of Christmas celebrations which made me realise how bad the UK is at celebrating Christmas. I managed to stay up until 10pm, and seem to have slipped back into a half decent sleeping pattern.

Today (so far) we have wandered around Central Park, taken lots of photographs, and eaten delicious bagels. Tomorrow we plan on doing more shopping (proper shopping this time) along with a visit to the Museum of Modern Art to see Tim Burton's exhibition.

All in all, I think I like this city. Some things about it are strange though. I really like the hotel we're in, but it does lack a bar (there is a mini bar, but with no price list I'm not risking it), and we could really do with a way to make coffee in the room. On the bright side, we're a stones throw from Starbucks and about 20 places to eat and drink, so it's hardly a massive chore to go out, explore, and try out lots of different nice food (on Wednesday I had the best pizza I've had for ages, and everything we've eaten so far has been great).

The first batch of photos should be on Facebook soon.
