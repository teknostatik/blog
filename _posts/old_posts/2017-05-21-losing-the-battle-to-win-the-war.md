There is a lot of talk of politics right now. I think it's inevitable, and it's a good thing that people are talking (and thinking) about ways to make the world a better place.

It's not that easy though, is it? Scrolling through my social media feeds over the last few weeks it's becoming clear that there are a number of different opinions, some of which I agree with and some of which I don't. That's not a problem either though, because it's good that I know people that have opinions sufficiently different to my own to make me think about what I believe in, and consider alternatives before making decisions. That's the world I want to live in, and long may it prevail.

What I'm less keen on is when opinions are presented as facts, and anyone who doesn't share those opinions is denounced as being wrong (or stupid, or any other negative word). That's what I don't want any part in, and why I don't engage in politics to a greater degree. For every strong opinion there is (by the very nature of opinions) and equally strong counter-opinion, which is believed (at least as) passionately by another group of people. It doesn't make them wrong, or make them bad people, it just means there is more than one viewpoint to consider (which to me is what makes them opinions, rather than facts).

Personally I'm all for trying to judge people on the intent of their words and actions rather than the unwitting impact they may have had on others (which is hard sometimes). And what comes out loud and clear about pretty much everyone I know is that they care about this world and want to make it a better place. How that manifests itself might be different, but the core motivation seems the same. And what's more, I don't think that core motivation is too different from most politicians and other public figures who speak out about these things.

Strong opinions and strong words are required to enact change, but not at the cost of our relationships with those closest to us. That's where I draw the line, and if I walk away from something it's generally because I'm prepared to lose the argument to save the relationship, or lose the battle to win the war.
