All the media hysteria about Michael Jackson dying reminded me of a little know freely available hip hop album made by Rhymefest a couple of years ago as a tribute to Jackson (albeit a quite tongue in cheek one). It's still available from [the artist's website](http://rhymefeststore.com/catalog/index.php?main_page=page&id=1&chapter=0&zenid=7286f1e4bd18c05779f624970c143009) to stream or to download, and is certainly a lot more interesting than anything the man himself made in the last 20 years.
