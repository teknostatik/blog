My day job currently involves a lot of development work, and not a lot else. As a result I'd pretty much decided that I would try and do different things while I was on holiday.  
  
So yes, apart from a day of testing beta versions of Ubuntu/Mandriva, an hour yesterday reading about the basics of [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) (and making Hello World), and an hour this morning reading through the Rhythmbox [bugs that are getting hugged tomorrow](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBugDay/20100408), I've done nothing with my computer above the level of just using it.  
  
This has left lots of time for general relaxation (which I'm rubbish at), interspersed with shopping (I now have more than one pair of shoes again), cooking (which I never tire of) and the first part of the tiding/de-cluttering which needs to happen before our new kitchen is fitted in the summer. There was also some family-based socialising, a wedding, and a great plumbing victory which finally fixed the flood in our kitchen (involving the realisation that the plumbing in our house is ever weirder than we thought).  
  
There was also the less wonderful realisation that Bennett's Bar turns into a trendy disco on Thursday nights that directly precede Bank Holidays. I'm glad I won't have to have this realisation again.  
  
I'm back to work tomorrow, and I'm actually looking forward to getting on with things. I've got a couple of hard deadlines coming up in regard to the release schedule of what I'm working on, so the time between now and 21st June looks madly busy (apart from May half term which I have booked as leave). I should also get round to organising some sort of release/birthday party, as the two are so close to each other.  
  
I should also make a concerted effort to write blog posts more often than once a month.
