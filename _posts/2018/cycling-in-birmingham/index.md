At the moment I'm juggling hospital visits, work, being a responsible pet owner, and all the other things I do. This has lead to a few logistical challenges, but since I was kindly loaned a bike a couple of weeks ago I have found new ways to do everything I need to do and still manage to see new parts of my local environment.

I'm not a fan of cycling on busy roads, and although I've done it a few times recently, it's very much a means to and end, and not an enjoyable journey. The ones I've enjoyed are where I can use parks, cycle paths and canals to get around - and Birmingham is surprisingly good for those kind of routes if you know where to look.

The journeys I've particularly enjoyed (with links to routes) are:

[The park near my house to Good Hope Hospital via Sutton Park](https://www.strava.com/activities/1550520648) - I've done this one 3 times now, and it doesn't go anywhere near a main road until Sutton Town centre. One day I will explore the top part of Sutton Park too, but that's a trip for another day.

[An alternate morning commute](https://www.strava.com/activities/1546419813) - This takes me to my local train station, but via two parks rather than a busy main road. It's quite short (I walk most of this with the dog a couple of times a week), but it's a really pleasant cycle when the weather is nice.

[Good Hope Hospital to the park near my house via lots of parks and cycle paths](https://www.strava.com/activities/1553441909) - After cycling back from hospital twice on the roads, I vowed never to do it again (especially during rush hour). This route got my home more quickly, despite being longer, and is at least 2/3 off road. It's also a really lovely ride through leafy cycle paths and past meandering streams.

[Witton Lakes to the City Centre, via the canals](https://www.strava.com/activities/1555301820) - I've dubbed this one the _canal graffiti tour_, but it's not quite as bad as it sounds, and it ends up at the Mailbox with only one tiny bit of road cycling on the way. I like graffiti quite a lot, so I suspect I'll be coming back to this one with a proper camera at some point.

All of this has been really enjoyable, so I guess I'll be buying a bike (or two?) soon.
