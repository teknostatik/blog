2018 has been a strange year in so many ways. I always said that I would try and buy less music this year, and instead, spend more time with the music I _did_ buy. This has very much happened, but there is also very little on this list that wasn't chosen by someone else (either as part of the Rough Trade club, or as a birthday/Christmas gift). That said, I love all of these records, and I think they represent an accurate summary of my journey through 2018.
