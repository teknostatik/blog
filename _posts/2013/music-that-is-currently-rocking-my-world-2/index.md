There has been so much good music released over the last few weeks. Unfortunately this has coincided with me being very busy, and so I'm still very much playing catch-up.

Things I have discovered so far that are well worth a listen include:

- Primal Scream - More Light
- The National - Trouble Will Find Me
- Vampire Weekend - Modern Vampires of the City
- The Indelicates - Diseases of England
- !!! - Thr!!!er
- Bill Ryder-Jones - A Bad Wind Blows in my Heart
- Mark Kozelek & Jimmy LaValle - Perils From The Sea
- The Postal Service - Bankrupt
- Daft Punk - Random Access Memories
- The Fall - Re-Mit

I've probably missed a few, but those are the ones that I am most impressed with on first (or second or twentieth) listen.
