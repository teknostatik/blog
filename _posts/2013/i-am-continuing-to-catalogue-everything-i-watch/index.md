Despite being very busy over the last few months, I have still managed to keep track of everything I’ve watched (apart from TV shows, which probably deserve their own post/project).

20th August - **Daybreakers**. In some ways this is a generic 21st century vampire movie, but I did like some of the science behind it, and found it entertaining enough to watch for a second time (I can’t remember the date of the first viewing, hence including it here). I also re-watched Dune on the same plane journey (London --> Vancouver), but I’ve already mentioned Dune elsewhere.

7th September - **Alphaville**. During a rare weekend off, I thought it might be nice to dip back into European cinema. I had a vague thought of trying a Jean Luc Godard weekend of movies, which I kicked off with this one. Alphaville is very strange, but also very thought provoking, and it takes aspects of Film Noire and 60’s detective movies and gives them a subtle sci-fi twist. Probably not a movie for everyone, but certainly enjoyable enough, and one that bears repeated watchings (and listenings).

7th September (later) - **Made in U.S.A**. Another Godard classic, and one I’ve not seen for at least 10 years. It’s worth it just for Anna Karina’s wonderfully 60’s outfits, but it is also another great example of the kind of story that Godard tells very well, as well as being another really thought provoking collection of images and sounds.

9th September - **Notre Musique**. Part 3 of my Godard spree, and the first one that is from the modern age (well. if 2004 counts as modern). I had read a review of this a while ago, and thought it sounded like something I would enjoy. The first section is very surreal and abstract, but it soon morphs into a more narrative (and longer) middle section that explores war, peace, and the conflicts between people of different nationalities. The third segment acts as a brief peaceful coda, and the whole piece does a good job of portraying the hell, purgatory and heaven of Dante’s Inferno (on which Notre Musique is very loosely based). I really enjoyed this movie, although I totally accept that it is not for everyone.

11th September - **Lancelot du Lac**. As a break from Godard, I stumbled upon this in the library today. It’s a 70’s retelling of the story of Sir Lancelot, in French, with a very odd style of acting that removes all animation and passion from the story, but is still strangely compelling. I enjoyed this more than I thought I would, although there are parts of it that seem very dated now, and it was very odd seeing a quintessentially English story being played out in French.

6th October - **On the Road**. This is a recent movie adaptation of one of my favourite books, and is fairly faithful to the book (with a lot of passages from the book used as narrative). It has the feeling of a proper road movie, and the jazz soundtrack makes it feel like an authentic period piece, but it also has something to say about life and love in the 21st Century. I was worried I might be disappointed by this movie, but it is actually one of the most enjoyable things I’ve watched for a while, and it makes me want to go back and re-read everything Kerouac ever wrote.
