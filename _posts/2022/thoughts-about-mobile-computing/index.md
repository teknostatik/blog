I've been thinking about mobile computing a lot recently. Now we are splitting our time between Birmingham and the Isle of Wight I have found myself using my laptop more and more (after it sitting largely idle during lockdown). I have also found myself starting to value portability much more, after a couple of years of building and optimising a powerful desktop computer connected to three large screens.

After our last trip to the island I bought [this screen](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B091KBNVHK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which is a great piece of kit that can be powered by my personal or work laptop, and can also be used as a main screen for a Raspberry Pi or my tiny-but-powerful MSI desktop that I use for hobby stuff or where I want a change of scene. Adding that to my setup adds more possibilities, and should make it absolutely possible to work from anywhere, providing the mobile signal is good enough to support tethering.

I also think I've settled on my other travelling peripherals, with my [Planck](https://drop.com/buy/planck-mechanical-keyboard) going everywhere with me (and my typing speed being back to normal on it now), and a [Kensington Orbit trackball](https://www.kensington.com/en-gb/p/products/control/trackballs/orbit-trackball-with-scroll-ring/) that is quite light and a lot easier to use than a mouse when working on a very small desk.

Talking of which, I've been using my phone as a hotspot while I've been on the island, and the experience is surprisingly positive. There is free wifi in various places, but it's easier just to tether and use my very generous data plan which I wasn't really touching before I started travelling again. Eventually I'll want a new phone to ensure that battery life doesn't impact my ability to work on the move, but the basic concept has served me well so far.

Now I just need to work out if I can carry this setup around on a small bike, ready for my solo tour of the Isle of Wight in September.
