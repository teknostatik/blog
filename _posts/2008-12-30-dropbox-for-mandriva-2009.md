I've just converted the latest Ubuntu build of nautilus-dropbox into something that will work on Mandriva ([download .rpm](http://teknostatik.co.uk/nautilus-dropbox-0.5.0-2.i386.rpm)). Again, this was done more to solve a problem of my own than anything else, but others are welcome to it as always.
