Today I've played around with [Planet](http://www.planetplanet.org) (the software behind [Planet Gnome](http://planet.gnome.org/), [Planet Debian](http://planet.debian.net/) and lots of other planets), and installed a demo version on our home server. It's actually quite straightforward, and I think I could theoretically get something up and running quickly if required. Of course, it does require people to have publically available blogs which could be an issue in some circles I move in.
