I've not blogged about [Ubiquity](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity) for a while. It's a Firefox extension that I use every day to do all sorts of things (updating twitter and complex calculations mainly). The latest version is out today, and has gone a long way towards making it ready for the masses to use.
