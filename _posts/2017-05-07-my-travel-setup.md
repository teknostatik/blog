My travel kit (for non-work travel) now consists of:

- iPad Air 2, 64Gb, silver
- Apple wireless keyboard and/or a [Â£10 bluetooth keyboard](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00QRQZLQO/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) if I won't be doing lots of typing
- [Bamboo stylus](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0050OFF42/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (one of several I have)
- [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://thepihut.com/collections/raspberry-pi-zero/products/raspberry-pi-zero), running [LibreElec](https://libreelec.tv/), with adapters/cables to plug it into most hotel TVs
- [Anker bluetooth speaker](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anker-Portable-Wireless-Bluetooth-Microphone/dp/B00GZC35YK/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1494184614&sr=8-6&keywords=anker+bluetooth+speaker) (sometimes, although the iPad speakers are really good)
- [Arctic 4-way charger](https://www.amazon.co.uk/ARCTIC-Charger-Pro-UK-Universal/dp/B007BNDOS4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1494184586&sr=8-1&keywords=arctic+charger) with various charging cables (charges any of the above devices, plus my phone)
- A [Grid-IT](http://www.cocooninnovations.com/grid.php) that carries all my cables, plus my iPad.

If I'm working I'll also have my Surface Pro 4 with me, but apart from that I rarely travel with a laptop these days.
