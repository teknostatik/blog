After over 3 years of _mostly_ remote working I very interested in seeing how other people set their home offices up for maximum productivity. I've made a lot of changes since the start of 2020, and I suspect many other people have as well. I had intentions a while ago to make a long list of people who have inspired me with their setups, but have only just got around to posting that list (which I will likely add to later).

Hopefully looking at these again will inspire me to consider if there are any changes I need to make to how _I_ work.
