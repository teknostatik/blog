I reviewed the first Abscondo album [a while ago](http://teknostatik.co.uk/?p=89), and actually still listen to it a fair bit. So I was actually quite nervous about downloading the second one in case it didn't live up to my expectations. Thankfully [Stages](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/43024) builds on [Midnight Snow](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/20092), whilst at the same time not deviating too much from the style that made the first album so enthralling. It's mainly all about the lyrics, which make me think a lot, and which are both political and personal without making me feel uncomfortable. There are also a couple of melodies that stick in my head like glue, which makes me think I'll be dipping in to this album over and over again.

It's availabe for free from [Jamendo](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/43024), and from the [artist's website](http://anotherdreamer.typepad.com/), and available to buy from iTunes.
