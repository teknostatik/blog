If I was buying a new PC, I think I'd get it from [EfficientPC](http://efficientpc.co.uk/). 8Gb of memory and 3Tb of storage for under £700, or more realistically some decent PCs that blow anything I use now out of the water for around £300 means it would actually be possible to buy a new PC for less than the amount of money I have left in my bank account at the end of the month.

Not that I'm going to buy one, I just like to price things up every now and again.
