I've just mixed a whole load of previously unheard music from [Jamendo](http://www.jamendo.com) in with my usual playlist in Rhythmbox. I'm not going to try and describe any of these (apart from calling them indescribable), but I think there are things here that people will like.

- [The Broken Symphony by Degiheugi](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/32555)
- [Lost Horizon by Chronique](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/28653)
- [\[1\] by Heet Seas](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/36917)
- [\[2\] by Heet Seas](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/37319)
