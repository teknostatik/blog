This month I largely listened to my vinyl collection, including about a week where I had Jim O'Rourke's _Simple Songs_ on loop. I also (re)discovered Jethro Tull's _Passion Play_ (both on vinyl and the Steven Wilson remastered version), and have had a bit of a New Pornographers/Sea and Cake binge. As a result, I listened to very little music that was actually released this month until the last few days of the month, after which time things went back to normal.

Mac Demarco - _Another One_  
Georgia - _Georgia_  
Paul Smith and the Intimations - _Contradictions_  
The Phoenix Foundation - _Give up Your Dreams_  
Pere Ubu - _The Pere Ubu Moon Unit_ (not on Spotify playlist)  
Drinks - _Hermits on Holiday_  
Frog Eyes - _Pickpocket's Locket_  
Tempel - _The Moon Lit Our Path_  
Destroyer - _Poison Season_  
The Bohicas - _The Making Of_  
C. Duncan - _Architect_  
Eleventh Dream Day - _Works for Tomorrow_  
Toro Y Moi - _Samantha_ (not on Spotify playlist, but [available for free](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/raajg71yzjperor/AABZYn6kJ9Hzb3O7rShxABf9a?))

Georgia's debut album was a bit of a bolt out of the blue. I'd not heard of her until I received the album through the post from Rough Trade, but it is pleasantly different to most of what I listen to, and very much a record for 2015.

Destroyer, Mac Demarco, Paul Smith, Eleventh Dream Day and Frog Eyes are safe bets for me. I own record by all five artists already, and between them they nicely cater for my need for interesting and intelligent song-based music. All of these records may very well be career highlights, and I'm particularly pleased that _Poison Season_ doesn't disappoint after the very high benchmark of _Kaputt_.

C. Duncan, Drinks, Tempel and The Phoenix Foundation I'd not heard of until this month, but are well worth a listen. Tempel remind me a bit of Pelican, who feature heavily in my _Post Rock Classics_ playlist.

And then there is Pere Ubu. They are another band I own a lot of music by, and (very much like The Fall) I always try and listen to everything they put out. This one is a very short live (I think) record, but it's interesting for fans (and probably not that interesting to anyone else). As an aside, I also picked up their _Cloudland_ on vinyl for for a lot of money, and have been remembering listening to _Waiting for Mary_ when it first came out (1989?) and thinking it was one of the best songs ever written. It's not, but it still brings back fond memories of summer and childhood and the period of time where I was starting to discover more alternative music.
