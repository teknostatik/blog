I'm really taken with the debut album by [The Big Pink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_Love). It reminds me of all sorts of other things, but above all it sounds like a record that really belongs on [4AD records](http://www.4ad.com/). I'm partly reminded of The Wolfgang Press and Dif Juz, but also a lot of 90's shoegazing bands.  
  
It's certainly well worth 11 emusic credits, and probably worth a lot more than that.
