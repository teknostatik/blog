Posted largely because I'm far too brain dead to finish any of the half-started posts about computers and/or music that I've started over the last few weeks.

1. The Hold Steady – Stay Positive
2. Frank Turner – Love Ire & Song + The First Three Years
3. Maxïmo Park – Quicken The Heart
4. The Hold Steady – Separation Sunday
5. The Decemberists – The Hazards of Love
6. British Sea Power – Do You Like Rock Music?
7. And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead – The Century of Self
8. Manic Street Preachers – Journal For Plague Lovers
9. Modern Skirts – All Of Us In Our Night
10. Robyn Hitchcock – Goodnight Oslo

Ok, so some of these are not from 2009, but I think it's a fair indication of what I've been listening to recently. Although Jarvis Cocker's new album would be on the list in about 2 weeks I think (the stats come from last.fm and the album is very new).
