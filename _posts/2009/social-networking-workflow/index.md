This is how it works.....

I post anything under 140 characters to [identi.ca](http://identi.ca/teknostatik) using the [Ubiquity](http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-ubiquity/) extension for Firefox. This then posts them to [Twitter](http://twitter.com/teknostatik) and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/home.php?ref=logo#/profile.php?id=223405348&ref=profile), and adds them to the right hand menu of this blog using the [Twitter Tools](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-tools/) plugin. Then, once a day, they all get spliced together by [Loudtwitter](http://www.loudtwitter.com/) and posted to my [Live Journal](http://clupea-rufus.livejournal.com/).

I also add posts to my LJ using the [Deepest Sender](http://deepestsender.mozdev.org/) plugin for Firefox. I only post there if I need to lock things down to custom groups of people (or if what I write cannot be in the public domain for whatever reason).

Everything else gets posted here. Also via Deepest Sender.

Additionally, everything I listen to all all my computers and my iPod is sent to [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/teknostatik), which then adds the last 10 songs to the right hand menu of this blog.

I think that is pretty much everything.
