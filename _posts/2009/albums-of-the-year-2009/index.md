Oddly enough, three of my most played (and favourite) albums of 2009 were released prior to 2009. They slot into the top 5 as follows:

1. _The Hold Steady – Separation Sunday_
2. The Decemberists – The Hazards of Love
3. Wilco – Wilco (The Album)
4. _British Sea Power – Do You Like Rock Music?_
5. _The Hold Steady – Stay Positive_

Nothing else from before 2009 got anywhere near the top 20 (_American Demo_ by The Indelicates being the closest by some distance).
