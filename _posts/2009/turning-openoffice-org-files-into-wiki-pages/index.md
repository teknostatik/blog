This week I've been looking at a few OpenOffice.org extensions that might make my life easier. One that certainly will is the [Sun Wiki Publisher](http://www.sun.com/software/staroffice/extensions.jsp#wiki). Basically it takes a document, logs in to a particular instance of Mediawiki, and converts that document into a wiki page (including table of contents, headings etc.). I've tried it with a couple of complicated documents and it did a fair job of converting them, and it is certainly something I will be looking at further at work this week, as I think it might solve a couple of long standing problems.
