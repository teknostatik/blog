I rave a fair bit about [Ubiquity](http://labs.mozilla.com/ubiquity/), but there are also a few other things from [Mozilla labs](http://labs.mozilla.com/projects/) that look promising. Last night I installed [Weave](https://labs.mozilla.com/weave/) on a couple of my computers, and am actually very impressed. Weave takes your Firefox history, bookmarks and tabs and syncs them across multiple machines. It worked flawlessly for me, and I would certainly recommend it to people who move between computers a lot.

I may have to try a couple of their other offerings, although I'm not exactly sure what all of them are meant to do.
