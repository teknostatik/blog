I don't write about [emusic](http://www.emusic.com) enough. I signed up a few months ago on a 50 songs a month package, and have downloaded countless really good songs that I would never have bought otherwise. This month I've concentrated on new releases, and have downloaded the new albums from Super Furry Animals, The Thermals, and Camera Obscura (as well as a smattering of individual songs). I'm aware that you need to have a fairly eclectic taste to get the best out of emusic, but I would really recommend it if you like Indie music and are organised enough to remember to download all your monthly allowance.
