The [nominations](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8159078.stm) for this year's [Mercury Music Prize](http://www.mercuryprize.com/) have been announced. Usually I have a fairly clear idea of who I think should win, but this year I'm torn between Florence & the Machine, Bat for Lashes and The Horrors. I've played all three to death this year, and I think all three artists really deserve a bit more acclaim and money. It also makes me want to check out the nominations I've not heard of, as generally I end up quite liking everything that gets nominated.
