I've just watched the latest two episodes of The Sarah Jane Adventures. Yes, it's kids TV, but it's also something any Doctor Who fan needs to watch.  
  
It's on iPlayer as of now:  
  
[Episode 1](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00nlx9r/The_Sarah_Jane_Adventures_Series_3_The_Wedding_of_Sarah_Jane_Smith_Part_1/)  
[Episode 2](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00nlxhc/The_Sarah_Jane_Adventures_Series_3_The_Wedding_of_Sarah_Jane_Smith_Part_2/)
