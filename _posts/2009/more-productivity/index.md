This afternoon I did a bit more work on our home server (the one I built from bits of my old dead PC).

It's now running:

- A full installation of Mediawiki, with a few extensions, which Steph is using a lot right now.
- A streamable repository of Creative Commons licensed music so that any computer in our house can stream a selection of new and interesting music. This works nicely with Rhythmbox and iTunes (I've not tested anything Windows based yet).
- A local access only mailsever (built around dovecot with a squirrelmail front end), which grabs a copy of all my incoming mail and archives it locally. This means I now have an extra level of backup in case I encounter more problems with my externally hosted mail.

All of this is controlled from webmin, so my main laptop is able to configure everything without me actually having to sit in front of the server. This is good, because the server is noisy enough to consider banishing it to the spare room.
