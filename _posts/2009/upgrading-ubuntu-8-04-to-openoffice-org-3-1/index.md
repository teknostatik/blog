[This guide](http://news.softpedia.com/news/How-to-Install-OpenOffice-org-3-1-on-Ubuntu-9-04-111105.shtml) has all the required info, and worked like a charm on my netbook running 8.04 and my laptop running 9.04 (although it was simpler than the guide suggests in both cases). I'll hopefully write a more comprehensive guide at some point soon, because I think 3.1 is something that people should consider upgrading to.

I'm really not noticing the fact that I'm running 8.04 on my Dell Mini, largely because I've upgraded most of what I use regularly to later versions.
