The PPC version of Debian Testing seems to solve all the problems I've been having with my iBook.

It's also the only Gnome based Linux Distro I can use for more than 5 minutes without changing the theme and wallpaper.

It might only be a backup laptop, but with my luck recently it's better to be prepared.
