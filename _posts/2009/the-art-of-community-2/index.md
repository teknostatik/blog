I've written about this [before](http://teknostatik.co.uk/2009/08/19/the-art-of-community/), but after reading the whole book this weekend I thought it was worth another mention.  
  
It's a book about communities, written by Jono Bacon (Ubuntu's Community Manager). What I like about it is that it gives a great insight on what it is like to be part of a community where creative people work together to make something great, but where the reward is not financial. I think anyone who is involved in any sort of voluntary activity would get something out of it, and I'm certainly looking at my own community involvement in a new light as a result of reading it.  
  
The Art of Community is available to buy (or to download for free) from [http://www.artofcommunityonline.org/](http://www.artofcommunityonline.org/).
