[This](http://teknostatik.co.uk/nautilus-dropbox-0.6.1-2.i386.rpm) should work on any recent version of Mandriva, but specifically on 2009 (current) and 2009.1 (cooker).  
  
So far so good, but as always, your mileage may vary. It's the first one I've built on a VM (my physical build machine died), but it installed fine on my EeePC, so hopefully all will be well.
