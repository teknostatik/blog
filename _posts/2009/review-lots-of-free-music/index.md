I may get round to reviewing The Mars Volta, Dinosaur Jr, Sonic Youth and Placebo, but as you can read about all of these in a fair few other places I thought I'd concentrate on a couple of months worth of free music (all licensed under Creative Commons so download away). [The Sound of Music by Pinkle](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/45335)

I like this a lot. It's lazy, charming and creative indie music, and fits the mood of a summer week off work perfectly. I've just downloaded two more albums in the hope that they are at least half as good (see [http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/Pinkle](http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/Pinkle) for a full catalogue of releases). I'd buy "The Sounds of Music" and will certainly be trying to find out more about the artist (EDIT: I've now found a website at [http://www.pinklemusic.com](http://www.pinklemusic.com) which explains more). [Dinner for One by Amity in Fame](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/28245)

Quite heavy, in a largely acoustic way (in the same was the new Mars Volta album is). I like this, and have found that it has got better with each listen. The only downside is that I've not wanted to play it from end to end for reasons I can't quite put my finger on. Certainly a burn it, although the title track in particular I'd pay for. [Animals are People Too by The Wind Whistles](http://aaahh-records.net/the-wind-whistles-animals-are-people-too/)

A record I waited over a year for, and one which has not disappointed. The songs are shorter than the last album, but there are more of them and they have a more indie rock feel to them. None of these are a bad thing, and I would gladly file it next to "Window Sills", which has been played a very large number of times over the last year.

[So High by Le Galago](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/43634)

A British melodic indie group who come from Birkenhead, and sound a lot like Muse to my ears. This is not a bad thing as such, and they certainly have a sound (and in particular a singer) that could take them places. I like this, but it doesn't tell me anything new about the world or myself, but I'm more than happy to listen to their songs when they appear on my playlist.

[2 Days a Night by The Liquid Kitchen](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/39522)

I downloaded this a while ago, and listened to it a fair bit on my way to and from work. To my ears they sound a lot like Neil Young fronting a bar band, and I really have to remind myself on occasions that I'm not actually listening to Neil Young. Great if that is what you are after, but it seems like this really is their only trick and I'm not sure it would stretch to a second album without an input of new ideas. Worth a download though.

[Born in the USB by William Doyle](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/44669)

I downloaded this for the title alone, but the music itself is rather fine too. It's indie with a slight psychedelic edge, and opening track "Beneath the Soil" is possibly my favourite song of the last few weeks. It tails off a bit towards the end, but still warrants a good few listens.
