I've been back at work a week now, and it really does change the way I listen to music. Over the past week or so I've actually only really listened to things whilst travelling to and from work, so at least half of my listening time is taking place quite early in the morning (where I prefer to listen to quieter and slower music). This has lead to me spending a lot of time with the new [Yo La Tengo album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Songs) (which I'd recommend as a good starting point), and also with the (still) brilliant [Wilco album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilco_%28The_Album%29), which gets better with every listen, and which might even be my favourite album of theirs now.

I didn't watch the Mercury Music ceremony in the end (Dollhouse was more pressing this week), but I'm slightly disappointed with the result. I've heard bits of the winning album, and I don't think it offers anything I've not heard before. I'd like to have seen Florence winning, but it doesn't change the fact that ["Lungs"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungs_%28album%29) is a great album that would appeal to most people who can appreciate music made by someone who gives a damn.
