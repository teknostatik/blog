According to last.fm, the list goes like so:  

1. Frank Turner – Love Ire & Song + The First Three Years
2. And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead – The Century of Self
3. The Hold Steady – Separation Sunday         
4. The Decemberists – The Hazards of Love   
5. The Hold Steady – Stay Positive     
6. Modern Skirts – All Of Us In Our Night     
7. Robyn Hitchcock – Goodnight Oslo   
8. Morrissey – Years of Refusal     
9. British Sea Power – Do You Like Rock Music?         
10. The Dada Weatherman – The Green Waltz

I think that's probably fairly accurate.
