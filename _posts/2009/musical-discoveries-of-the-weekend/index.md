[Various freely available MP3s by Portugal. The Man](http://portugaltheman.net/content/downloads/) \- I'd not heard of this band until about 3 hours ago, but am actually quite taken with them now. It's American indie with a strong side order of psychedelia, and I think I could handle a whole album of this easily.

[The Butcher's Ballroom by Diablo Swing Orchestra](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/49216/) - Another great name, and an album that I can only describe as a cross between Opera and thrash metal. Except it is a lot better than I've made it sound, and is the sort of thing that should be made into a musical. [Before We Stand... We Crawl by Hungry Lucy](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/34073) - Interesting trip hop, with a female singer who can sing, and some killer melodies to go with it.

All are freely available to download.
