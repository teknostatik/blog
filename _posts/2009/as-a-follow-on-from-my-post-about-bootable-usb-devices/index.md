[EfficientPC](http://efficientpc.co.uk/gadgets/usb/) are now selling USB devices pre-installed with Ubuntu (from 2gb up to 16gb). I blogged about how to make these last week ([see here](http://teknostatik.co.uk/?p=512)), but this gives another option for people who don't already have the hardware/software required to make their own.
