This week I've largely been:  

- Listening to the new albums by The Flaming Lips, Atlas Sound, Charlotte Hatherley and Broadcast (all of which I'm really enjoying)
- Updating my main workstation to [Ubuntu 9.10](http://www.ubuntu.com)
- Learning about [Google Wave](http://wave.google.com)
- Trying to juggle various work tasks (and not dropping anything hopefully).

Oh, and I still hate this time of year. Even though we had no annoying begging children this year, there is still the firework-hating dog to deal with.
