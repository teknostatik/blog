So far this weekend I have:

- Built a webserver out of the useable parts from my dead PC (and the case of another less powerful machine).
- Set up webmin on all my Linux machines and built a webmin cluster.
- Copied 10gb of music (the stuff I actually listen to) onto my new laptop.
- Rebuilt my old PC (OS and config files) as a VM on my laptop.

So all in all a busy weekend.
