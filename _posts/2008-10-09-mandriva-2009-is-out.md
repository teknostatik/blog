[http://torrent.mandriva.com/public/](http://torrent.mandriva.com/public/) has everything you may need. Known issues are at [http://wiki.mandriva.com/en/2009.0\_Errata](http://wiki.mandriva.com/en/2009.0_Errata)

I like this release, and think it's the prettiest Mandriva release for ages (if not ever). I may get round to updating tonight, but it will more likely be tomorrow when things are a little quieter.
