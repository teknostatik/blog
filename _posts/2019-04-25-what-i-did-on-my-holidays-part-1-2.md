The Easter holidays have been great. The weather was good, and while I didn't stay more than 20 miles from Birmingham I did get out and about a lot. Highlights include an excellent British Sea Power gig at The Crossing (with great food and drinks beforehand at the Digbeth Works & Baked in Brick), three long bike rides (including finally exploring the [Rushall Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rushall_Canal) and repairing my first thorn puncture), and a lot of epic dog walks.

Part two will see more walking in Cornwall (in less pleasing weather, generally), before finally returning to work on 2nd May.

In other news, I replaced both my main computer and bike earlier this month. Both replacements were largely like-for-like and drama-free, and I've repurposed my old computer as an emergency WFH Windows machine, and will eventually repurpose the old bike as a pub/shopping bike, once the bottom bracket is replaced.

I have a few vague plans for May and June already, but I also have a long list of concerts I've not booked but could be persuaded to attend:
