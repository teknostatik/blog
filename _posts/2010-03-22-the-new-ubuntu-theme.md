I'm not sure I like the new Ubuntu theme. But I should probably mention that since I started using Ubuntu in 2005 I've not used any default theme for longer than a day, and have instead largely stuck with the default Gnome theme (currently Clearlooks), or anything that is blue and doesn't get in my way.  
  
I'm a great fan of user interface, and think a good interface is integral to a pleasant computing experience. But I also believe in the freedom to make my computer look however it needs to look to be productive for me. I've had a play with the beta version of 10.04 tonight, and it took me about a minute to get it looking identical to what I'm used to.  
  
This largely means that although the new theme is not to my taste, it will in no way make me less productive. And being productive is all I really care about because the quicker I can do what I need to do on my computer, the quicker I can be spending time doing the things that really matter.
