I thought it might be useful to mention that I turned off all email notifications on social media sites a few months ago. I do still get banner notifications on my phone, but I found myself ignoring the emails on the whole, and thought I'd remove a bit of noise from my inbox. I still regard myself as active on (in this order) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/teknostatik "Twitter"), [G+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/110271544580458190349/posts "G+"), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/teknostatik "Facebook") and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=27969772 "LinkedIn"), but I also still very much regard email as my primary method of contact for anything urgent/important, be it personal or professional.

I suppose it's also useful to mention that I've started scheduling a few posts, both to my blog and to my social networks. I very much try and keep content relevant to my (perceived) audience, but if you do see me posting things when you know I'm at work or in a meeting with you, then scheduling is probably the answer (I use Buffer for scheduling, and may write more about this soon).
