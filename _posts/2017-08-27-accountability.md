At the start of the year I wrote [a blog post](http://teknostatik.co.uk/2017/01/03/2017-plans/) about things I might do differently this year. Not resolutions as such, just lines in the sand and broad statements of intent. As the year is nearly two thirds of the way through (how?), I thought it was time to look at those statements of intent, see if anything had noticeably changed, and note anything else eventful that had happened.

The first thing I wrote about was visiting the cinema more. Apart from a slight lull in the spring this has gone very well, and I've seen 14 films this year so far. It's not quite enough to make the unlimited card worth it, but when you add in discounts on food and drink and other benefits it's just about paid for itself (although I do resolve to go to the cinema slightly more often in the cold winter months to make sure I get value for money). I also set up a (private) Wordpress site to record everything I've seen, everything I want to see, and to otherwise document my cinematic adventures. Let's face it, if I'm doing something then there is probably a Wordpress site somewhere to document it.

The second thing I wrote about was my relationship with technology, and in particular how I was using my iPad more for personal computing (and my Surface Pro 4 for work computing). The last 8 months has probably been the least remarkable period of time in regard to changes in how I use technology, and I don't think a single thing has really changed (apart from my diminishing love of the Surface). I've not bought a computer of any type this year, and spent a very small amount of money on technology in general. I've travelled several times with just an iPad, and have found that the thought of doing that is nowhere near as remarkable as I thought it might be at the start of the year. If anything _has_ changed it's that I'm using MacOS and Ubuntu _at the same time_ rather than choosing between them, due to having a bigger desk that will fit two monitors, although the jury is still out as to whether I'll actually replace the Mac when it finally dies or becomes obsolete (it's 6 years old now).

The third thing I wrote about was music, and how I planned on buying less but listening to it more. This has largely gone as expected, although I did go through a period in the spring where I bought a few extra CDs, and it really took me until about May before the vision of the future I was aiming for actually came to pass. I've also noticed that I've started listening to older music a _lot_ more this year, with as lot of old favourites getting significantly more airtime that records that came out this year. I'm not sure whether this is a blip or a trend yet, but it will be interesting when I do my yearly review to see how many records from before 2017 make the list.

The last thing I wrote about was socialising, and how I wanted to do more of this (but didn't have a plan). This is probably the area where the most has changed, and I've been more socially active (especially with people from work), and have done a wider range of things (cinema, walking and comedy nights rather than just food and drinks). As predicted, it sorted itself out organically, and I can't pretend I really did anything to make this happen.

The other key thing that happened recently is that I stopped eating meat (and then eventually fish) at some point at the start of this year. It wasn't a conscious decision (at least not at first), but once I realised I'd stopped and I felt better for it then it was a bit of a no brainer to just make it a thing I didn't do any more. I've found it surprisingly easy, and I've found I'm learning more about food and how it affects my body as a result.

I think the only other things of note are that I bought my first pair of varifocals last week after a period of diminishing eyesight, and that at some point in the spring I started drinking proper coffee again and tried to cut out the instant rubbish as much as possible. Both of these are probably only of interest to me, although I'm sure people around me are glad I can now do things like read menus in restaurants and actually see what is on the screen of my phone.
