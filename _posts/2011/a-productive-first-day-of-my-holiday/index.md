Today was a day for doing computer-related things. I've had a brief play with [Gnome 3](http://gnome3.org/) and [Unity](http://unity.ubuntu.com/) (again), and still found both of them getting in my way a lot more than I'm used to. I will persevere though, because I figure that eventually I'll end up using one or the other, and could actually do with knowing about both.

I also took advantage of having my very fast work laptop with me and built a few virtual machines as part of a personal project that I'll write about in more detail at some point soon. Suffice to say, using the Macbook Pro was remarkably painless, and it really does offer a viable Unix development environment, especially when working with Virtualbox (which I work with a lot). I'm also 75% towards getting Unity and Gnome 3 running virtually (both have fairly steep graphics requirements), and I'm hopeful I'll be able to build something that other people could use before the end of my Easter break.

Apart from that I've done very little, but have plans for the next two days so should be out and about a bit more.
