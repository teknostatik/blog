[Repurpose and Upgrade Your Old Technology This Weekend](http://lifehacker.com/5752411/repurpose-and-upgrade-your-old-technology-this-weekend?skyline=true&s=i).

Lifehacker started me thinking that I really need to do something with the largely un-used computers we have lying around our house. But apart from playing around with KDE on one of them I've not come up with anything yet.

Ordering new kit for work always makes me want to do interesting things with my home setup, so it's quite possible that a change is on the cards soon.
