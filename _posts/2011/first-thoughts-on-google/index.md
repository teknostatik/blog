I'm liking [Google+](http://plus.google.com "Google+") a lot so far. It looks like Google have taken everything they learned from Buzz and Wave, everything they've borrowed from Facebook, and a few other nice features, and rolled them together into something I think I'll probably use quite a lot.

I like the idea of Circles in particular. I know a lot of people from all sorts of different places, and I like the idea of being able to aggregate their posts for my benefit, whilst easily segregating what I write so that it only reaches interested parties. I know other social networking sites do this to some extent, but this is the best application of that feature I've come across so far.
