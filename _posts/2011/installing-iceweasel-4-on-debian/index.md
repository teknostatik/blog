As I've said previously, I'm a fan of new software, but also of stability. So today I decided I needed Iceweasel (Firefox) 4 on my Debian virtual machines (it's been a quiet day and I was doing a bit of sys-admin work). As it turned out it was practically zero effort, as all the instructions were [already written](http://mozilla.debian.net/ "Mozilla's Debian repository").

So that's the latest version of both my main browsers running on all three versions of Debian, which makes it a viable option for being productive and getting things done.

I may write more about Debian at some point soon, as I find myself using it quite a lot at present.
