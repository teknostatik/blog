I'm not sure how I missed this one.

The Dresden Dolls live album _A is for Accident (Collected live recordings 2001-2003)_ is available to download on a pay-what-you-want model from [here](http://dresdendolls.bandcamp.com/album/a-is-for-accident "A is for Accident, but also for Amanda"). In this case "what you want" can also mean free, so you really have no excuse if you like their music.

You can also download their eponymous debut album under the same model from [here](http://dresdendolls.bandcamp.com/album/the-dresden-dolls). This one is definitely worth paying something for.
