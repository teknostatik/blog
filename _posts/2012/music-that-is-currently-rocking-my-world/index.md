I often get asked to recommend music, which I'm often very bad at because I know from experience that a lot of what I listen to might not be to everyone's taste. But if I was recommending some music from this year (or from recently but that I largely discovered this year) then my list would look something like:

Shearwater – Animal Joy The Twilight Sad – No One Can Ever Know Craig Finn – Clear Heart Full Eyes Metric – Synthetica Veronica Falls – Veronica Falls Pog – Between the Station and the Sea Moonface – With Siinai: Heartbreaking Bravery Crystal Stilts – In Love With Oblivion AAAHHHRCHESTRA – Denmaaahhrk Lana Del Rey – Born to Die Thieves Like Us – Bleed Bleed Bleed Tindersticks – The Something Rain Paul Heaton – Paul Heaton Presents… The 8th The Wedding Present – Valentina Maxïmo Park – The National Health Bear in Heaven – I Love You, It's Cool The Flaming Lips – The Flaming Lips And Heady Fwends Errors – Have Some Faith In Magic Tennis – Young & Old Julian Cope – Psychedelic Revolution Guillemots – Hello Land! Stevie Jackson – (I Can't Get No) Stevie Jackson The Kabeedies – Soap John Zorn – Templars: In Sacred Blood Holograms – Holograms Shanir Ezra Blumenkranz – Abraxas: The Book of Angels Volume 19 Allo Darlin' – Europe John Zorn – The Gnostic Preludes Yeasayer – Fragrant World David Krakauer – Pruflas : The Book Of Angels Volume 18 Swans – The Seer The Indelicates – Diseases Of England Craft Spells – Gallery The Fall – Your Future Our Clutter Amanda Palmer & The Grand Theft Orchestra – Theatre Is Evil
