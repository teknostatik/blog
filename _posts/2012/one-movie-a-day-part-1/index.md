Over Christmas I set out to watch (on average) a movie a day. This is what I chose (and why) over the first few days.

19th December - **Let Him Have It** (the story that inspired the Elvis Costello song 'Let Him Dangle' which has always been one of my favourite songs)

20th December - **Pollock** (the artist Patti Smith named her son after. I listened to her new record this morning and it blew my mind. The music at the end of the movie is 'World Keeps Turning' by Tom Waits who I also adore)

21st December - **Prozac Nation** (I read the book ages ago, but somehow managed to miss the movie. Mental illness is a subject close to my heart right now, and Lou Reed playing Lou Reed is always worth watching in any movie)

22nd December - **A Dangerous Method** (I love David Cronenberg as a director, and thought I would round off my series of movies based on true stories with this. Despite only being made last year it does a very good job of looking significantly older, and it makes me really look forward to Cronenberg's next movie which is an adaptation of Don DeLillo's Cosmopolis and which will feature music composed by Metric)

23rd December - **Black White + Gray: A Portrait of Sam Wagstaff and Robert Mapplethorpe** (I've just read Patti Smith's 'Just Kids'. This movie-length documentary covers roughly the same period of time, and adds new perspective to an already familiar story)

24th December (a.m.) - **New York Stories** (This is probably one of my favourite movies, and one I keep coming back to when I want something familiar and not too mentally challenging. It also reminds me a little of Paul Auster's 'New York Trilogy' which is one of my favourite books)

24th December (p.m.) - **The Last Waltz** (I stumbled on a CD of 'Music From the Big Pink' in a bargain bin this year, and I keep coming back to these amazing songs that I couldn't get enough of at University. I think this is a fitting way to see in Christmas)

There will be more over the next few days. Largely a lot of things I'm getting for Christmas with one or two old favourites thrown in. I may also start documenting some of my listening habits regarding records made before I was born, which I've not really touched on elsewhere.
