I didn't used to be a morning person, but now I am. I had to learn, because in 2004 I very quickly went from starting work at 2pm, to starting work well before 8. I have a few things that I think help, although I'm not always as good as I should be with some of them.

1\. Go to bed early enough to get the amount of sleep you need.

2\. Declutter your mind, in whatever way works for you (meditation, music, tea, gin, all of the above). The plan being that when you go to bed you're not mulling over things from the day before.

3\. Set an alarm for the time you need to get up, and get up straight away when it goes off. Snooze buttons do really contribute a lot to being groggy in the morning, and actually lead to less good quality sleep as well.

4\. Only give yourself enough time at home in the morning to do the essentials. So if your morning routine takes 20 minutes, then set your alarm for 20 minutes before you need to leave. Any other time you have will probably be wasted, and working to a strict deadline may kick start your brain into heightened activity.

5\. Eat breakfast. Breakfast is important. I generally eat two breakfasts - one as part of my morning routine, and another one when I actually get to work.

6\. Use all your commuting time productively - to read, listen to music, work though things that are bothering you, or just to mentally prepare for the day.

7\. Work out what sort of tasks you do best at certain times of the day, and try and plan your working day accordingly. For instance, I write best in the early morning, so schedule all my report writing, funding bids and that sort of thing into a morning slot. I brainstorm best around mid-morning (or late evening), and so make sure anything that involves ideas generation or collaborative work is scheduled into those slots. I'm groggy in the afternoons, so I use that time for meetings where I don't need to contribute ideas, or anything mindless. I accept that I am lucky in this respect in that I have a lot of control over what my working day looks like, but it's at least worth trying to map task types to times of the day.
