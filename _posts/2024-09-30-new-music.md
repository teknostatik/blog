I've worked for my current employer for 24 years. On the day I had my interview I bought two albums on the way home. Once was _Kid A_ by Radiohead, the other was _Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven_ by Godspeed You Black Emperor!. It amuses me that this week I'm writing about two records that are made by some of the same people, and then one that definitely wasn't.

My three records for 4th October are:

* ["NO​ ​TITLE AS OF 13 FEBRUARY 2024 28​,​340 DEAD"](https://godspeedyoublackemperor.bandcamp.com/album/no-title-as-of-13-february-2024-28340-dead) by Godspeed You! Black Emperor
* [Cutouts](https://thesmile.bandcamp.com/merch/the-smile-cutouts-standard-lp-uk-row-orders) by The Smile
* [The New Sound](https://geordiegreep.bandcamp.com/album/the-new-sound) by Geodie Greep

I think I know what I'll be listening to on Friday.
