I've been maintaining a lock down blog since the start of April. Reading through it I note with interest that there is very little there that I wouldn't want on the public internet, and that a slightly redacted version might serve as a decent record of these difficult times. I could just dump these into my regular blog, but as with my [cycling blog](https://andy.teknostatik.co.uk/cycling) and my [micro-KB](https://andy.teknostatik.co.uk/kb) I thought it was worth keeping it separate (because containers are still important to me). I think this might be the one that aggregates to Twitter (for now) though, as I'm hardly prolific enough anywhere else to make copying and pasting links into Buffer a particularly time consuming task.

[https://andy.teknostatik.co.uk/lockdown/](https://andy.teknostatik.co.uk/lockdown/) is where it lives. It's live now, and should be updated most days until we reach whatever the new normal looks like. I will still write here about music and technology, but probably at my usually sporadic rate.
