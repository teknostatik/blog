September was a month where I spent a lot of time at work and not a lot of time listening to music. Many evenings I found myself listening to Max Richter's _From Sleep_ as a way of winding down from a long and busy day, but I also watched a lot of TV (_Lie to Me_ and a fair bit of sport), and well as being pleasantly surprised by New Order's new record which arrived right at the end of the month. I think [this review](http://thequietus.com/articles/18834-the-lead-review-mick-middles-new-order-music-complete-review) sums up my thoughts fairly well. The rest of these I've listened to a few times whilst commuting, but have not spent the time with them that I would have liked.
