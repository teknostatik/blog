I downloaded this album because I liked the front cover. It reminded me of "Funeral" by The Arcade Fire, and I thought that as The Rest were also Canadian they might be operating in the same sort of area. Reviews of this album have even likened it to The Arcade Fire, but also to U2 and other fairly large and commercial bands.

"Atlantis, Oh Our Saviour" sounds a little like quite a few bands I like, but also does a good job of sounding exactly like it should. There are quiet parts, loud parts, and screamed-into-the-microphone parts (sometimes within the same song). There is rock, orchestral pop, electronica, and a strong sense that this is the start of something beautiful.

I feel the same way I felt when I first heard The Fleet Foxes, The Arcade Fire or (if you can remember that far back) Jeff Buckley's "Grace". I can't pick out favourite tracks because you just have to listen to it all and see if you have room for it in your life.

"Atlantis, Oh Our Saviour" can be downloaded for free from [Jamendo](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/27993).
