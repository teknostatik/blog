This morning I've been thinking about mortality, and about all the people I see and talk to (and all the people I don't see and don't talk to but still care about). If I knew that I only had one remaining conversation with each person, what would that conversation involve? What things have remained unsaid that should have been said years ago? What unfinished business needs to be resolved before it is too late?  
  
The truth is, none of us know how long we've got. Maybe it's time to start treating every conversation as the last one we might have with that person, because, eventually, one of them will be.
