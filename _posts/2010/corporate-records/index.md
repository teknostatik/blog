This week, I've been exploring [Corporate Records](http://corporaterecords.co.uk/), which offers music on a "pay what you want" model that I quite like.  
  
Things I've downloaded so far include:  

- [Songs for Swinging Lovers](http://corporaterecords.co.uk/artists/The+Indelicates/Songs+For+Swinging+Lovers/) by The Indelicates
- [Ghosts in a Burning City](http://corporaterecords.co.uk/artists/Red+State+Soundsystem/Ghosts+In+A+Burning+City/) by Red State Soundsystem
- [Oh No...](http://corporaterecords.co.uk/artists/Lily+Rae/Oh+No.../) by Lily Rae

All of these are great in different ways, and are well worth a listen. I've also tracked down a few bizarre alternate arrangements of Indelicates songs, and a very strange band called Anal Beard who are amusing if nothing else.
