This week I have been on leave. I've not really been anywhere, but have largely spent the week either at home, or out with family.  
  
My plans for the week were to reinstall my laptop, get my hair cut off, and do something about de-cluttering the house. It's now Thursday, and I'm well on track to get all of the above done (with only some of the clutter still outstanding). I've also eaten well, slept properly, and generally managed to avoid stress, impossible people, and other such things.  
  
On a technical level. I've not done anything too productive, but have been playing around with [Google Sites](http://sites.google.com/) to see what sort of things it is capable of. So far I like the RSS features, but am not really seeing anything that would make me move away from Wordpress in the near future.  
  
I'm back to work on Monday, and am sort of looking forward to it. I think this probably makes me sad.
