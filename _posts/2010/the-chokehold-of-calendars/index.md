[Mule Design Studio’s Blog: The Chokehold of Calendars](http://weblog.muledesign.com/2010/10/the_chokehold_of_calendars.php).

_Meetings may be toxic, but calendars are the superfund sites that allow that toxicity to thrive. All calendars suck. And they all suck in the same way. Calendars are a record of interruptions. And quite often they’re a battlefield over who owns whose time._

_In my experience, most people don’t schedule their work. They schedule the interruptions that prevent their work from happening._

I largely agree with this. For a while I've been booking out huge blocks of time to ensure that I actually do what I need to do and to match the tasks I have to complete with the time of the day I'll be at my most productive.

It makes me wonder why more people don't do this, because from where I'm standing it really works.
