This weekend I decided to try and use different tools to perform my usual computer-based tasks.

Yesterday, I tried to do everything in Mac OS X (Leopard), and also tested out [Thunderbird 3](http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/). I reckon I could live with a Mac as my only computer, and the only thing that bugged me was the speed (my Mac is somewhat ancient now). I especially liked iCal, and how it integrates perfectly with the Google calendars that map out my whole life, and I love the way OS X renders fonts and colours. Thunderbird 3 was a nice surprise, and I love the way it integrates with Gmail. Maybe I'll consider switching back to Thunderbird the next time Evolution does something to annoy me.

Today I've been using the [daily build of Chromium](https://launchpad.net/~chromium-daily/+archive/ppa) on my netbook. It's seriously faster than Firefox, and I'm finding that I can do pretty much everything I need to do without a plethora of extensions. This might be one to keep I think.

I'm also having monitor envy. Or possibly screen resolution envy. I think I may be nearly ready to consider spending my day looking at something larger than a laptop screen.
