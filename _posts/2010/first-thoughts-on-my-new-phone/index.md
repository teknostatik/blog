This Christmas I got a Samsung Galaxy phone running Android. I've never had a phone that could do much more than make phone calls and send text messages before, and my new phone feels a lot more like a small computer than anything I've owned before.

My initial impression is very positive. It will deal with most of my email and internet needs, and because most of what I use is Google based, everything is integrated perfectly. I can see this phone being used for about half of what I use my netbook for, and I might even be tempted to leave the house with just the phone on occasion.

I've also set up an app called talkmyphone, which allows me to optionally forward all my phone's alerts to my IM client on my computer. So if my phone is downstairs and I'm upstairs then I can still read and reply to texts and know I've been called. I may have to experiment with this further at a later date.

As far as other things go, I've got dropbox set up, and can take photos and make videos which sync straight to my dropbox account (and thus to all my computers). I've also copied a few Gb of music over, and was pleasantly surprised that it will sync with Rhythmbox, although I think I'll be managing music manually as I have a lot of music and only 14Gb of space on the phone.

As far as phone calls and texts goes, it works fine, and does what I need it to, which was actually my main fear about getting a smart phone. I was a little worried that something that can do everything would do the core tasks less well, but this doesn't seem to be the case at all.

Oh, and I discovered Angry Birds. It ate an hour of my life and about 20% of my battery. I may have to explore it again soon.
