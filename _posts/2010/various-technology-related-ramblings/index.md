I was going to write a post about the [iPad](http://www.apple.com/ipad/), but I think most of what I wanted to say has been expressed in quite a few other places. Largely, I think it looks pretty, but the lack of customisation and multitasking mean that if I was to get one, I don't think I'd get the use out of it that the price tag would require, although I do concede that this product is going to appeal greatly to non-technical users.

I should also mention Firefox 3.6, which actually does seem faster than 3.5, and which I've been using for a few days now without noticing anything different other than the speed (I like new things, but I also dislike unnecessary interface changes because they cause my brain to have to think for an extra second or two).

Ubuntu users wanting to get hold of the latest releases of Mozilla software might want to try the [ubuntuzilla repository](http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/ubuntuzilla/index.php?title=Main_Page) which seems to work a treat.

What else?

Well, I've not really stumbled upon any other new and interesting technology this week, largely because I've been up to my eyeballs in work and have had very little recreational internet time. I have however noticed that Facebook seems to be prompting me to "reconnect" with people I see every day (it's not suggested Steph yet, but it's only a matter of time), which makes me wish there was a setting to define people with whom I largely interact with offline. That way Facebook might actually prompt me to talk to people I really do actually need to reconnect with.
