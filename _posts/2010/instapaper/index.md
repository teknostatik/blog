[Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/u) is something I think I'd use a lot if I had an ebook reader. Basically, it takes web pages and turns then into ebooks for offline reading. At present it's not a great deal of use to me, but for anyone with an ebook reader or an iPad it might prove very handy.
