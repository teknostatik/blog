[New BlackBerry PlayBook & Tablet OS at BlackBerry.com](http://na.blackberry.com/eng/?IID=rim_playbook_homepage).

Visually this looks really good, although I think it would be much more useful to someone who actually uses a Blackberry.

In other news, I've been taking the iPad to every meeting I've been to over the last few weeks, and have actually found I'm getting a lot of use out of it. Somehow it seems rude to pull out a laptop to demonstrate something quickly, but the iPad seems totally permissible in these circumstances. Yes, there are things I'd change, but it is certainly an enjoyable mobile computing experience.
