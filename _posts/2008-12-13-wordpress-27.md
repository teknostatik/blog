I wasn't sure I needed to upgrade this website to [Wordpress 2.7](http://wordpress.org/) (the latest version of the blogging software which acts as a front-end for everything else here), but as I missed the last couple of releases I decided it might be a good idea.

The upgrade went flawlessly (following the [3 step upgrade](http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress)), and I've also added OpenID support so that Livejournal users who read this will be able to leave me comments using username.livejournal.com as an OpenID (replacing "username" with their own username).

I don't _think_ anything is broken, but let me know if this is not the case.
