Yesterday was the release day for the new album by The Cure. I used to try and pick up their albums on release day when I was younger, but don't think I have managed to do so since _Wish_ as very long time ago.

My first thought is that this record is _really_ good. I keep trying to compare it to other Cure albums, and the best that I can do is that it's a _bit_ like the best parts of _Disintegration_ and _Bloodflowers_. There isn't a bad song on it, and I think it's something I'll come back to for many years.

If you like The Cure you will love this. And if you like music in general it's definitely worth a listen.

In the evening there was the album launch concert, which took place at The Troxy, but was also [broadcast live on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aWDlaxvEZo) which meant I could watch it without all the logistical challenges that a concert in London presents. It started with a performance of the whole new album, which is what I expected, but was then followed by a 2+ hour set of old favourites and a few things I wasn't expecting (such as a whole segment dedicated to songs from _Seventeen Seconds_). It reminded me how important this band were to me when I was growing up, and how much time I have spent listening to their music. I think this lineup is probably the best ever; although it's not _too_ different to who was on the stage in 1989 when I last saw them play live.

Everyone looks older, but they still sound great, and these songs definitely stand the test of time. I think the new ones will as well, and am hopeful that the rumours of one more album before they retire are true.
