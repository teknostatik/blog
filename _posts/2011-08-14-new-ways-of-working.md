My day job is currently taking me deep into the heart of Mac OS X. It's not a bad place to be, but it requires me to think in a slightly different way. Thankfully I don't really have to touch Windows at the moment, which means I'm only bouncing between OS X and Linux, which isn't too far to jump, and feels quite comfortable now.

This slight shift in focus has lead to a shift in the hardware and software I use, and I've found myself (finally) using the GMail interface more and more for email, and Â almost reaching the point where I do pretty much everything through a browser of some sort. I've also used about 10 different Macs over the last 6 months, so might get round to writing some sort of comparison post at some point.

Oh, and the other change in the way I work comes from Google+, which seems to be the place where I post videos and babble about music.
