I've been compiling a list of my favourite records of each year for a decade or more. This year I've listened to music slightly differently; with monthly Spotify playlists on shuffle during train journeys and walks, but otherwise by putting a record on my record player and listening to the songs in the order they were sequenced. This is the second half of the list (the first half can be found [here](https://andy.teknostatik.co.uk/blog/2019/12/15/albums-of-the-year-for-2019-part-1/)).

### Belle & Sebastian - _Days of the Bagnold Summer_

Part 6 of my review of music from 2019 takes me back to September. I spent about half of September in Japan, and as a result couldn't buy this record until it had been out a couple of weeks. It was my soundtrack to that trip though (thanks to Spotify), and also to the desolate weather and subsequent mood crash that followed my return to the UK. Many people will know that Belle & Sebastian are one of my favourite bands, and this record serves as a great introduction to them, from the re-recordings of two old favourites to the newer songs that may themselves become old favourites in the years to come. They managed to provide at least two of my favourite songs of last year (_Cornflakes_ and _Best Friend_) and in _This Letter_ and _Safety Valve_ they have added two more songs that just seemed to perfectly sum up how I was feeling at the time I first listened to them. They have made better records, but for now this one will do nicely.

### The Delines - _The Imperial_

My seventh record of the year is from January, when 2019 was only a few days old. I loved the soulful gin-soaked vibe of the first Delines record (Colfax), and this one picks up very much where the last one left off. It's very much an album of stories, with clear narratives, believable characters (with names - which reminds me a bit of The Hold Steady), and songs that sound like they could have been written at any time since the early 70s. This isn't a fashionable record, and I suspect it won't be in many end of year lists, but it's one that is well worth giving a chance to if you are interested in well-written songs performed to perfection.

### Cigarettes After Sex - _Cry_

My 8th record of the year is much newer than most of the rest, but definitely deserves a place on this list. The first Cigarettes After Sex record was on my list in 2017, and I was wondering what direction they would go in next. The answer is very much that they are going in exactly the same direction, but are much closer to getting there. It's very much still all about crooning falsetto, shimmering guitars, and lyrics that don't look like anything special when written down, but which still manage to blend perfectly with the music; but if anything there are even more great songs this time around. This record sound-tracked most of November and December for me, and if the year started in November it would easily be my record of the year.

### Durand Jones & The Indications - _American Love Call_

This is a record that I got as part of my Rough Trade Club membership, and I don't think I would have given it a chance otherwise. From the cover I had it pegged as retro American soul, and while that's not too far off the mark there is something about this record that transcends genre and just transports me to America in the sunshine instead (not bad considering I've only ever been to America in December). Both vocalists can _really_ sing, there isn't a bad song on the record, and it has very quickly become the record I put on if I just want to feel _better_ about myself and the world for a little while.

### William Doyle - _Your Wilderness Revisited_

For my 10th selection I'm going to pick something that I've only owned for a few days, but which I've loved since the first time I've heard it. William Doyle used to record as East India Youth, but this record is very different than anything that has gone before, and swaps electronic music for something more organic and breathable. It still does a fair bit of genre-switching, but is on the whole a collection of excellent songs with clever and thoughtful lyrics. Words are important to me, and these words are perfect.
