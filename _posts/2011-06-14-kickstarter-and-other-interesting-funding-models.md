[Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/) is a website where fans of artists and musicians can fund new records or performances, in return for receiving advance copies of the art form in question. Â It is a funding model that interests me, and it gives me quite a buzz to receive advance copies of records I would have bought anyway, with the knowledge that I played some sort of part in creating them. The latest record to come out having been funded via this method is [Marissa Nadler's eponymous album](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/marissanadler/help-marissa-nadler-record-her-new-album-0), which is a really beautiful collection of songs.

I'm also quite intrigued with how the Kaiser Chiefs are releasing [their new record](http://www.kaiserchiefs.com/album/create), and have already bought my version of it.
