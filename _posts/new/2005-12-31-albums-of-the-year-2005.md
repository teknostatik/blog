2005 was the year I learned about computers, and learned that it is possible to jury rig old equipment to deal with today's tasks with a bit of elbow grease. It was the year I rediscovered Dylan, Fairport Convention, and other folk-rock goodness. It was the year I bought more new music than any time since my late teens. It was the year where I rediscovered old friendships, and cemented a few newer ones. And it was the year when I finally found a job that stretched me and gave me a sense of worth.

It was also a year that I can look back on and honestly say was a happy one.

I end this year dividing my time between Birmingham (where I work) and Steph's house in Hinstock. This arrangement works well, and gives me a much needed dose of country air, as well as the company I need to keep me sane. I've travelled as often as any other year, I've just not travelled as widely.

And now for my albums of the year (in the order they are stacked on my desk):

Rufus Wainwright - Want Two  
The Arcade Fire - Funeral  
The Mars Volta - Frances the Mute  
Antony and the Johnsons - I am a Bird Now  
Bloc Party - Silent Alarm  
The Dandy Warhols - Odditorium or the Warlords of Mars  
The White Stripes - Get Behind me Satan  
Sufjan Stevens - C'mon Feel The Illionoise  
The Magic Numbers - The Magic Numbers  
Death From Above 1969 - You're a Woman, I'm a Machine
