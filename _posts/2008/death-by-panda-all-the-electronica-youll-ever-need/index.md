I've written about [Death by Panda](http://deathbypanda.net/) before (around the time I was listening to "House Made of Glass" on repeat). Since then there have been three further albums, all of which explore an area of music that can be disconcerting, but that does a damn fine job of sounding both computer-generated and very human.

The new album is called Straight Lines in Subjectivity ([direct download](http://rainbowdestroyer.com/releases/straightlinesinsubjectivity/Straight%20Lines%20in%20Subjectivity.zip)).
