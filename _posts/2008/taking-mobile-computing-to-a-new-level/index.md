Over the last few weeks I've not had an office, or even a proper place where I could set up a computer and work. As a result of this, I've been exploring the concept of mobile computing (using laptops for everything, and working wherever I could get a wireless signal). It's been quite eye opening; and has actually made me more productive because it was meant if I am working on something that requires tranquillity I can move somewhere quiet, whilst if I need collaboration and input I can move my laptop to where the people I need to talk to are working.  
  
As a result of this, I've got used to carrying a laptop with me wherever I go. This has lead to increased shoulder muscles (both laptops I've been using are on the heavy side), but has also lead to me being able to write a quick blog post, check email, or work on the fly wherever I am. At the end of each day I've synced all my data back to a central server, so that everything I write on any computer is all stored in the same place (and is the most recent version thanks to the wonders of rscyc). This also ensures that if a laptop I'm working on gets lost or broken then I don't lose too much in the way of data.  
  
My new office is finished now, but since I have just bought an EeePC I still plan on using the mobile computing model on occasion, because I think it really does work.
