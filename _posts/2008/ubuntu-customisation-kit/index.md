[Ubuntu Customisation Kit](http://uck.sourceforge.net/) is a great bit of software that allows Ubuntu disc images to be customised and then rebuilt. Uses I've found so far include:

- Making a totally up to date installation disc that can be used on multiple computers without having to install a month of software updates afterwards.
- Making an installation disc that contains what I actually need so that I don't have to add and remove a load of software when I install a new system.
- Customising a LiveCD for fixing laptops and data recovery.

I'm sure I'll think of more.
