Due to weddings and holidays, I've got a 10 album + backlog of things to write about. But as I'm off on my travels tomorrow I thought I'd mention a couple of the albums I'll be taking with me to keep me occupied at the airport and on the plane to Verona.[](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/20092)

[Midnight Snow by Abscondo](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/20092) - I downloaded this about a week ago, and there has not been a day since when I have not listened to it at least once. This is singer-songwriter fare, but with a twist and a dark underbelly I really like. Download it here for free, or buy it from iTunes for Â£7.99. I did the former, but had I discovered it from another direction I would happily have paid. You might also want to check out [Imperfect People](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/20552), by a related group called Sungod Abscondo who I might grow to love almost as much.

[Not Quite Connected by Josh Woodward](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/7168) - This is more acoustic and folky than the other two albums I have, but I think it is actually my favourite. There are no stand-out songs as such, but it's all really good and has been my "walking to work" music for over a week. It also makes me feel really happy, and I suppose will be the record I associate with getting married as it is the last thing I played before the ceremony.

And that will have to be it for now. Tomorrow I head off to Italy with my lovely wife (and my EeePC for potential blogging opportunities of course).
