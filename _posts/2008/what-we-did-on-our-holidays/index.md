**Tuesday 19th August, 8:00 PM**

The start of the road trip.

We checked into the Premier Inn earlier this evening. It's a really nice hotel, is close to the airport, and does a really nice steak and ale pie. They have reasonably priced internet access too, but as we have to go to sleep soon and will have to leave by 3:30am then I don't think it's really worth it.

Tomorrow we leave for Italy. I'm really looking forward to this trip, and also to spending a week relaxing with my lovely new wife (I don't think I'll ever tire of typing that).

**Wednesday 20th August, 5:22 AM**

I'm sitting in Frankie and Benny's at Birmingham International Airport, having just had a huge breakfast. We've been up since 3am, but so far I feel rested, unlike Steph who had several nightmares and didn't sleep a great deal. It is times like these that I value my ability to sleep (and wake) at any time of the day.

Still no free wireless access to anything but the airport's own web site, but that in itself is useful.

**Thursday 21st August, 12:00 local time** We've now been in Italy over 24 hours, and are both enjoying it greatly. We arrived in Verona on time yesterday, and travelled to Peschiera by coach. The apartment we're staying in is gorgeous, with tiled floors throughout, a large balcony, and most importantly air conditioning. It's been 35 degrees here for huge portions of yesterday and today, and it's really good to come back to something a little cooler when we want to eat and sleep.

One downside is that the plug adaptors we were sold in the UK to use on this trip actually don't work in Italy (we did ask - they lied). I'm running my laptop off batteries at present, so I'm hoping to pick up an adaptor in the next 24 hours.

We opted for self catering so we could properly experience living in Italy. Yesterday we bought huge amounts of ingredients, and have cooked one proper meal and three snack meals already. Food is quite reasonably priced, and wine is very cheap (3 euros for a decent bottle of red), so hopefully we should be able to survive on the money we bought over with us.

I think we've finally caught up on sleep now, after only getting a few hours the night before. Both Steph and I woke around 9, so I think we managed 11 hours each yesterday.

Plans for the next few days involve exploring Peschiera town centre later, Verona all day Sunday and Venice on Monday. We've taken a few photographs already, and will probably take lots more over the next few days. One thing we have photographed lots already is the cute lizards that live near where we are staying. They are everywhere and are fascinating to watch.

I will hopefully write more when I have a reliable power supply for my laptop. **Thursday 21st August, 23:00 local time**

Talking of which, the hotel loaned us an adaptor, so we can now charge the EeePC, DS Lite, and various other bits of tech we have with us.

Tonight we went into Peschiera for pizza, red wine, and an evening of soaking up the atmosphere when it was under 35 degrees (also known as dark). Both food and wine were good, and the whole meal cost under 25 euros, which is a lot less than it would cost in the UK. We've also booked onto a wine tour on Saturday as well as the Verona and Venice trips.

**Friday 22nd August, 17:32 local time**

Today we travelled by boat to the town of Bardolino, which is where a lot of the wine we have drunk this week was made. The boat journey was very pleasant, and an hour after leaving Peschiera we arrived in Bardolino in the blistering heat. Most of our time there was spent having a very long lunch (with coffee and wine), but we did manage a walk along the lakeside which nearly killed us (yes, 35 degrees again today).

We have taken a lot of photographs so far. I've backed up the first batch onto my laptop in case we drop the camera in the lake or some other such misdemeanor.

Tonight I plan on cooking either pasta or risotto with the vegetables we have left. I don't plan on doing a lot more than that until it gets cooler.

We've been here three days now, and I'm totally relaxed. This bodes well for the rest of the holiday.

**Sunday 24th August, 8:25 local time**

Yesterday we went on what was billed as a "wine tour". It was actually a drive to a castle in the hills, complete with thunder, lightening, and torrential rain. We got to taste 4 local wines, and did get a whole large glass of each, so by the time we finished we were getting rather tipsy, but there was bread, cheese and meat to go with it which at least soaked up some of the wine.

There were lots of British tourist types on the wine tour who were complaining about the rain. They seemed to think it never rains in Italy for some reason, and thought they might catch hypothermia in temperatures warmer than the UK average. I think they may have been mistaken.

Afterwards we went out for dinner, and had pasta dishes and more wine. I think we probably had 9 glasses each over the course of the day so we should probably take it easy today.

We head off to Verona in an hour or so, and then to Venice tomorrow. We have taken over a hundred photographs already, with hopefully many more to come.

**Sunday 24th August, 22:38 local time**

Today we went to Verona, and then out for a posh restaurant meal. In Verona, we visited:

- Arena (a large amphitheatre)
- Casa di Giulietta (the house of Juliette)
- Tomba di Giulietta (the tomb of Juliette with added Christian art)
- Museo Lapidario (museum of Greek and Roman stuff)

We also had lunch in a nice cafe.

In the evening we went to a lovely restaurant, and had fish, salad, and amazing wine. We are now drinking more wine back at the apartment, so I might have to rewrite this in the morning, if it ends up looking less than good. **Tuesday 26th August, 9:55 local time**

Yesterday we spent the whole day in Venice, visiting Palazzo Ducale (palace of the Doge), seeing the sights, and eating a decent meal of lasagna and fish. My impression of Venice was that everything was overpriced, it was far too commercialised, but it still managed to be beautiful, stunning, and exactly what I hoped it would be. We arrived back just before midnight, drank a couple of glasses of wine, and then collapsed until 9am.

I've also transferred the 550 photographs we have taken so far to my laptop. I will post selections on Facebook at some point over the next week. **Tuesday 26th August, 19:33 local time**

Today we returned to Bardolino by ferry, and ate the hugest plate of salami and other cooked meat that I have ever seen. The boats were running on "Italian time" today, so it took us ages to get back.

We return home tomorrow. I'm looking forward to getting home, but have had an amazing holiday.
