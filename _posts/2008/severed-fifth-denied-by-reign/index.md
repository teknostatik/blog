Severed Fifth is the musical alter-ego of Jono Bacon (a name that might be familiar to many Linux users). The album is available from [here](http://www.severedfifth.com/) (various formats), and while it is proper metal, it is also oddly melodic in places. I think if I'd not weaned myself back on to this sort of music with the new Metallica album then I'd hate this. As it is, I think I actually quite like it and would recommend it to anyone who likes their metal fast and loud.
