I installed [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) on my windows PC at work today). So far I think it's ok, not anywhere near as useful as Firefox, but certainly has some interesting ideas. The buzz surrounding it suggests that we are likely to see a lot more of it in the next year or so, so watch this space.

What amuses me most though, is that by lunchtime over half our office were using Chrome. I think we're just all early adopters at heart.
