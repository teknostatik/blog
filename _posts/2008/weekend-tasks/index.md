This weekend has been very busy with wedding preparations and socialising. However, I've still found time to install the latest version of Wordpress on this blog, set up some backup scripts for all my home and work computers, and also to install [KDE4](http://www.kde.org/) on my laptop.

I'm still not sold on KDE4, but I think it has potential. I may try and use it for a few days to see if it actually does what I need it to.
