As promised, a few scribbles on things I've downloaded this week (mostly from [Jamendo](http://www.jamendo.com)). All are rated on the [Sound Opinions](http://www.soundopinions.org/reviews.html) "Buy it/Burn it/Trash it" scale.

[Ze first cidi by Delph' sans les pattes](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/12600) - Very French, but very beautiful, this is a style of music I like a lot but didn't own much of until recently. It's what I refer to as "Paris Cafe Music" but what other people call Chanson. Definitely a "Buy it".

[The Dreamer's Paradox by JT Bruce](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/3317%20) - An instrumental Progressive Rock album that makes great background music. I would never pay for music like this, but it's totally inoffensive, and worth a listen. I think this would have to be a "Burn it" at best.

[Encore des chansons (2008) by Saint-Jean](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/25317) - More wonderful French music. I may have to download more of this as it fits the beautiful summer weather perfectly. This would have to be a "Burn it", because I think I'll grow tired of it eventually.

[Who is on my Sofa? by Poxfil](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/15656) - I don't know how to classify this. There's a bit of dub, a bit of pop, a lot of strangeness, and very few reference points to hang it all off. Think the Beta Band crossed with ACR in a loft in Paris. I did put this as a "Burn it", but a week on I actually really like it.

[The Asylum theory by Ghostfog](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/18162) - German Darkwave, which is an excellent example of German Darkwave. It totally doesn't work at this time of year but I might go back to it in winter. Probably a "Burn it", although I might end up trashing it at some point.

[Feed the Animals by Girl Talk](http://74.124.198.47/illegal-art.net/__girl__talk___feed__the__anima.ls___/) - Not from Jamendo, but released under Creative Commons so it belongs here. Girl Talk mix bits of existing songs into new compositions, which works a lot better than you would think. They've been on my radar for a while, but have just released their new album on a "pay what you want" deal, so I thought they were worth another mention. This is a total "Buy it" album, and should be played loudly at cooked meat events throughout the summer.
