As I did last week, I've written a few notes on things I've downloaded this week. All are rated on the [Sound Opinions](http://www.soundopinions.org/reviews.html) "Buy it/Burn it/Trash it" scale.

[Dirty Wings by Josh Woodward](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/7098) - I downloaded this on the back of listening to his most recent album last week. "Dirty Wings" is less acoustic, rockier, and gets downright political in places, but is still obviously by the same person who recorded "The Simple Life". I really like this record, have played it on several occasions over the last few days, and would recommend it as a good starting point. I'd give this a "Buy it", but if you are burning selected tracks then go for "Gallows Hill" first.

[Orgamilk and Make This End by Fresh Body Shop](http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/freshbodyshop) - I've only had these a couple of days, but felt they were worth a mention. "Orgamilk" is a totally acoustic record, with quite delicate melodies and some fine songwriting. "Make This End" wants to be Nine Inch Nails, and almost manages it on a couple of tracks. I'm not sure if these guys have a career plan, or are even still together, but they are certainly worth checking out in a "Burn it" kind of way.

[The Intimate Stranger by Curious](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/21450) - This band want to be The Cure. A lot. I really wanted to like this, but I actually couldn't make it all the way through to the end. The songwriting is ok, but the singer's voice really grates, and they are not doing anything I've not heard a thousand times before. Trash this, or better still accept that I've suffered so you don't have to.

[Take it or Leave it by Terremoto](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/6352) - Great songwriting, which reminds me of the Go Betweens (who I adore). Unfortunately, the sound quality is dreadful, and some songs are almost unlistenable because of this. I really hope someone pays for them to record these songs in a proper studio, because if they did then this would be a "Buy it" record.
