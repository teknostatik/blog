I've been experimenting with Mozilla's new (very much still in development) [Ubiquity](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity/Ubiquity_0.1_User_Tutorial) tool, which does a lot of what Quicksilver and Gnome-do can do, but is also expandable to an almost unlimited degree.

I was going to write a tutorial on how to use Ubiquity to post to Twitter, but it's really as simple as starting Ubiquity and typing one line as seen below:

`twitter Type your status here`

Hit enter, and your post appears on Twitter. It's really that simple.
