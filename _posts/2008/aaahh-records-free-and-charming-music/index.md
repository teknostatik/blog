I've just stumbled upon [this net label](http://aaahh-records.net/), whilst trying to determine which year the Wind Whistles album was actually released in (the answer being 2007 and 2008 in different places).

The label has so far only released three albums, but two of them happen to already be on my list of favourite freely available music for this year, which makes me think I'm likely to like anything they put out.
