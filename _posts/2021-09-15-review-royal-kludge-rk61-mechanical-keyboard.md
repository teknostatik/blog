I bought this a while ago (with a decent discount) because I wanted a cheap hot-swappable keyboard to test different types of switches I might want to put in my main keyboard. After using it in anger for a few days while I've been off work I actually think it compares _very_ well to more expensive options, and it's the only 60% I've found so far that could _maybe_ replace my Motospeed CK61 as the keyboard I reach for which I want a loud 60% typing experience on my downstairs computer.

A quick web search suggested that this keyboard might be programmable (despite no mention in the manual). After a bit of a trawl through the Royal Kludge website I found a [link for the software](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pYSejq2HeEBnoI69B-dIHa29YfPj8u0j). It's Windows only, but I have an old laptop that just runs software for programming keyboards so I was able to install it and make the one tweak that wasn't already enabled.

All I actually had to change was mapping Caps Lock to F5. With the arrow keys where they are I can use this 60% keyboard with no macropad providing what I'm doing doesn't require using the forward slash a great deal, and whilst this doesn't leave me with any more keys to programme, it does mean I can use this for extended periods of time without having to user layers or macropads.

So this keyboard now fulfils all the criteria for my perfect keyboard:

- 60% UK layout
- Hot-swappable
- Programmable

It's also Bluetooth, which actually makes it better than anything else I have based on those criteria. It's not as solid as the GMKK, but if I had to use one keyboard forever then I think it would be this one (especially if I needed to travel). It pairs nicely with my iPad, and I have no doubt it will do the same with my laptop and phone (it handles a maximum of three devices, which is probably enough).

I'm currently running this with Kailh Jade Green switches and keycaps which I already had, so it's definitely been a budget build so far. I suspect more customisation may happen eventually, although I am perfectly happy with this set up for now and very much recommend this keyboard; even to people who are not interested in keyboards and just want a nice typing experience.
