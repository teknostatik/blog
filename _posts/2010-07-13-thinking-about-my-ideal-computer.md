I am a big fan of [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/), which is basically a bunch of people talking about what hardware and software they use to do their job. I sometimes think I should answer these questions a couple of times a year, just to track the changes in the way I work, but mostly I find myself thinking about my dream set up (the last question they ask everyone is about their dream set up).

I change my mind on this a lot, but what I basically want is a laptop that is thin, light and stylish, and that can perform at the level where I could use it as my only computer. The nearest thing I've come across is the 13" [Macbook Pro](http://www.apple.com/uk/macbookpro/), although I'd be happier with something the size and weight of my 10" [Dell Mini](http://www1.euro.dell.com/uk/en/home/Laptops/inspiron-1012/pd.aspx?refid=inspiron-1012&s=dhs&cs=ukdhs1) with all the power and stylishness of the Macbook Pro.

I also wonder if having a desktop computer with two large monitors would make me more productive. I have a feeling that most of what I do can be achieved on a single small screen, but it would be nice to have the opportunity to experiment with these things.
