The second day in any new place is generally when I start to settle in. Yesterday was no exception, and included a trip to two supermarkets and several shops, an evening in a lovely outside bar, and then the first film of the holiday (_Dr Strange_, which I actually enjoyed a lot more than I thought I would). Everything here seems reasonably priced, with even quite decent wine significantly cheaper than the U.K.

I also did a little research into [some of the interesting sights from yesterday](https://twitter.com/teknostatik/status/868902703614840832), and found that the odd juxtaposition of iconography I noted in yesterday's blog was actually due to the monument being created long after any of the historical periods it referenced. There _are_ a lot of older things here (including churches and a ruined castle), but there certainly don't seem to be any historical or mythological treasure maps that I can find at present.

It's a holiday here today (DÃ­a de Canarias), so shops will be shut and the streets will be full of celebrations. I suspect we may go and join them at some point later, before planning further excursions for the rest of the week.
