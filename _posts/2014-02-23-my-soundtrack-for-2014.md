The following records have pretty much soundtracked my year so far:

James Vincent McMorrow - Post Tropical Mogwai - Rave Tapes The New Mendicants - Into the Lime Dum Dum Girls - Too True Step Brothers - Lord Steppington Angel Haze - Dirty Gold Thee Silver Mt Zion - Fuck off Get Free we Pour Light on Everything Snowbird - Moon Xiu Xiu - Angel Guts : Red Class Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks - Wig out at Jagbags Actress - Ghettovillle Sun Kil Moon - Benji Marissa Nadler - July

I've also found myself listening to my _Post Rock Classics_ playlist a lot over the last couple of weeks. Lots of Mogwai, Tortoise, Caspian, Pelican and other such things. Maybe I am just in the mood for wordless music right now.
