I'm quite pleased with what I've achieved over the last two weeks. This holiday was supposed to be a chance to recharge prior to a very busy period at work, but I think I've actually been about as productive as I normally am (just in different ways).

I've done a _lot_ of technical things while I've been off, including dismantling (and throwing away) 5 old computers, building a server/workstation using a lot of spare parts and a new case/motherboard, and setting up Wordpress Multisite on the new server (and then building a site to host my Continuous Professional Development Portfolio which I have to do as part of ILM5). I've also decluttered my study, set up a new Raspberry Pi Zero, written a lot of notes about fixing specific technical issues I've encountered whilst doing all these things, and ripped about 100 CDs to MP3.

The decluttering has felt very liberating, and I plan on doing more of it (and throwing out more computers) in the summer. Of course, all this means is that I have an even larger pile of old hard drives and memory (even after using 3 of each in the new server) that I need to dispose of at some point.

As well as technical things I've also visited the Sea Life Centre, been out for two meals, and booked tickets for various shows. I've certainly spent a _lot_ less money than a two week holiday abroad would have cost, and I'm feeling like my technology setup is moving in the right direction again.
