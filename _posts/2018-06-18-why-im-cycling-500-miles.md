The NHS have helped us a lot over the last few weeks. Without the NHS we would probably have remortgaged our house by now (or tried to), and we have met lots of skilled, dedicated, and above all _nice_ people.

They are struggling though. From old computers, to inefficient processes, to an IT system that doesn't seem to be fully joined up, there is so much that is crying out for more funding, more fixing, and a little love.

That's why I'm [cycling 500 miles and asking for Â£500 in sponsorship](https://t.co/ga53feMjUh) I generally hate asking for things, but it turns out when it's not for me then I don't mind. I in no way believe that doing this will change lives (apart from perhaps mine), but it's one of those small things that might at least contribute to something bigger, and should at least give _something_ back.
