I didn't discover much new music in December, and the one thing I did play over and over again was a compilation of tracks previously released in 2013 and 2014. I'd not heard of Golden Teacher until I received their record through the post, but I really like it (both the 8 song vinyl version and the 12 song CD). They remind me a lot of late 70s/early 80s post-punk/funk, which is not a bad thing for something to remind me of at all.

The full list for December is:

Golden Teacher - _First Three EPs_ (not on Spotify playlist, although I've added 5 tracks from previously released EPs)  
Chorusgirl - _Chorusgirl_  
André Bratten - _Gode_  
The Spike Orchestra - _Cerebus : The Book of Angels vol. 26_ (not on Spotify playlist)

That's not a long list. December never is. But there is always the inevitable (much longer) list of records I only discovered in December when I saw them in someone else's end of year list. A few of those are listed below:

Jlin - _Dark Energy_  
Stara Rzeka - _Zamknęły się oczy ziemi_  
Dick Diver - _Melbourne, Florida_  
EZTV - _Calling Out_  
Young Guv - _Ripe for Love_  
Wolf Alice – _My Love Is Cool_

I also note that the Grimes album is out physically this month (which I'll write more about in my end of year review), and also that a deluxe version of Benjamin Clementine's debut album has just been released, which is well worth a listen. Sometimes the Mercury Music Prize _is_ won by someone who really deserves it.
