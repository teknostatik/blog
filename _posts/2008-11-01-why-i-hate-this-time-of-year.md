This is not a post about any of the things I usually blog about, but I thought it was worth making a note of.

October and November are fast becoming my least favourite months of the year. It's too cold, everyone is miserable, and our household is in a state of siege mentality due to the constant sonic bombardment that comes from the endless firework displays that our neighbours seem to love.

I actually like fireworks. I think they are pretty and that they cheer people up at a time when shorter days and less sunshine can drag us all down a bit. However this view is not shared by our cats, and most especially by our dog who has now been prescribed a herbal remedy for his firework phobia (valium didn't work and we've run out of other viable alternatives). He's currently sat on the floor underneath my desk and he's visibly shaking. He'll probably be like this for a few hours during which time he'll not eat, not sleep, and be very fractious and downright unpleasant.

So yes, that why I'm not too keen on this time of year and also why we're unlikely to be out and about after dark for the next couple of weeks at least.
