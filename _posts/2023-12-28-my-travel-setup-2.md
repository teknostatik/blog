As we prepare to start our third year/season of splitting our time between Birmingham and the Isle of Wight, I thought it was about time I blogged about my current travel setup. In this context, "travel" mostly refers to what I use on the island, but also partly to what I use when I am somewhere that isn't one of the usual paces I live or work.

## Things I store here

Apart from the table and chair, I think I have had most of this stuff over a decade. But it still serves me well for 9 weeks of the year.

- [Desk riser](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B007CYBY5C/?coliid=I287OIBCH87JU4&colid=12FT8F83XD1C0&psc=0&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it) - this is one of those adjustable ones that can convert any desk into a standing desk, but can also raise a laptop or monitor to the correct eye height
- [Folding table](https://www.argos.co.uk/product/9278211) - slatted, so that it will break down into a small enough package that it can be easily stored
- 24" Monitor and cables - an old one that I've had over 10 years and that was replaced at home by something newer
- Desk mat - because of the slats I need something to provide a surface that my laptop, keyboard and pointing device can sit on without moving around
- Speakers - old Logitech ones that I used to use at home before I wired up my home computer with an amplifier and dedicated speakers
- Extension lead - to power everything
- Webcam - I do also travel with one, but if I am working here it's really important to have one, and the webcam in my laptop is not good enough for work. This is a really old Microsoft one that we have quite a few of in various places
- [Folding chair](https://www.bmstores.co.uk/products/luxe-velvet-folding-chair-grey-3787001) - from B&M, and small enough to be storable. I used to use a patio chair, but I needed something that would be better for my posture
- USB mouse - in case I forget my trackball
- Amazon Basics USB hub, that I use to connect my keyboard, trackball and camera to whatever laptop I am using. It's like a docking station, but cheap and old.

## Things I carry with me

- Personal and work laptops (both ThinkPads). For longer trips I may bring my very small desktop PC.
- [Kensington Orbit trackball](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B002Q42S4E/?coliid=IIXFNAC607QZ9&colid=12FT8F83XD1C0&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it)
- [Ferris Sweep mechanical keyboard in a travel case](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/ferris_sweep)
- [Portable USB-C monitor](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B091KBNVHK?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)
- [Mobile internet](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08CZYM51X), although if we are in one place for a while we remove the SIM card and put it in a [more powerful router](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08VJMWTCM/). 
- [Trust webcam](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08B73KHKS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- Whatever cheap bluetooth headphones I am using at the time
