I've built an RPM that installs fine on my installation of Mandriva 2009 (RC1).

Downloadable from [here](http://teknostatik.co.uk/nautilus-dropbox-0.4.1-2.i386.rpm), but I'm only prepared to say that this works for me right now, as I've not tested it elsewhere.

Update: this version of Dropbox will also install on Mandriva 2008.1 on my EeePC. Mission accomplished.
