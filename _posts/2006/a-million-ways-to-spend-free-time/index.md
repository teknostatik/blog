Free time, it's like free money really. Free money is things like lottery wins, tax rebates, and one-off performance related bonuses. The kind of money you can spend without guilt because it doesn't feature whatsoever in your budget. Free time covers things like bank holidays, getting up an hour early by mistake, and finding yourself sent home early due to a bomb scare. I find free time quite productive, because somehow it doesn't even occur to me to do things I _need_ to do, meaning I can instead concentrate on fun things that might contribute to my general well being in a more abstract fashion.

And so, today I have trawled the internet for useful things that might make my life easier, but are more likely to keep me amused for a short period of time and then fade into insignificance.

And then in a moment I'll get a pop-up window and an email telling me to get downstairs, open a bottle of wine, and watch Doctor Who. Technology is great sometimes.
