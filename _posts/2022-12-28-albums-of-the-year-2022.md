These are the records that have been the soundtrack to my 2022. It's been a good year for music, but a bad year for the world. There have been positive changes in my personal and professional life, but otherwise this is likely to be a year that is remembered for all the wrong reasons.

I'm sitting writing this on a wet and blustery evening in the Isle of Wight. I think the amount of time I've spent here this year has definitely influenced some of my choices, but only in a good way. There is some music that just makes more sense in a rural location, and many of these records are definitely not particularly influenced by cities or suburbia, so probably have a slightly different feel to my previous lists.

## Singles

All of these are either one long song, or a 7" with at least three songs. They are all also part of my Quietus subscription or very limited edition pressings, so there are some things here that people can't actually go and listen to, which is a shame as they are all great.
