January is usually not great for new releases. But this week so far I've taken delivery of new albums from British Sea Power (which I'd highly recommend) and The Decemberists (which Amazon seem to think I deserve two days before it's available in the shops). I also think we may be getting new albums from both Amanda Palmer and The Indelicates in the next couple of weeks, which I'm very much looking forward to.  
  
My album of the year has never been released in January before. Maybe this year it will be.
