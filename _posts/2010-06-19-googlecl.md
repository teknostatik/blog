I really like the idea of [GoogleCL](http://code.google.com/p/googlecl/), and think it has a lot of potential to make my life easier, seeing as I use a fair few google products (specifically Google Calendar which I use to organise my whole life).  
  
It's fairly basic at the moment, but I think with a bit of development it could be a powerful tool. I particularly like the ability to add and remove calendar entries from the command line, the ability to query different calendars, and the fact that I could (should I wish) delete every entry on my calendar containing a specific keyword with one command.  
  
For example, `google calendar list today title` gives me a list of everything I have to do today (times would be great, but I can't seem to get that to work as yet), and `google calendar add "Dinner with Steph tonight at 8pm for 2 hours"` will add a two hour appointment to my default calendar. If I had a calendar specifically for dinner appointments (called Food for the sake of this example), I could add the previous command to it by typing `google calendar add --cal Food "Dinner with Steph tonight at 8pm for 2 hours"` instead.  
  
I think I need to experiment further with this, because it has great potential.
