There is a lot of music below, and it transpires that some of it was actually released at the end of June, rather than during this month as I originally thought.

Oh, and for the jazz haters, there is jazz here (especially towards the end of the list).

The full list of music I discovered in July is:

Beyond the Wizard's Sleeve - _The Soft Bounce_  
DJ Shadow - _The Mountain Will Fall_  
Bat For Lashes - _The Bride_  
Old Fire - _Songs from the Haunted South_  
Swans - _The Glowing Man_  
Plaid - _The Digging Remedy_  
The Julie Ruin - _Hit Reset_  
Metronomy - _Summer 08_  
Róisín Murphy - _Take Her up to Monto_  
Let's Eat Grandma - _I, Gemini_  
Aphex Twin - _Cheetah_  
Jack and Amanda Palmer - _You Got Me Singing_  
BadBadNotGood - _VI_  
If These Trees Could Talk - _The Bones of a Dying World_  
Christian Fennesz & Jim O'Rourke - _It's Hard for Me to Say I'm Sorry_  
Jambinai - _A Hermitage_  
Jeff Parker - _The New Breed_
