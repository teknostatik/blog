This is probably not the [album of holiday photographs](https://www.flickr.com/gp/92351128@N00/Y32471) that people want to see, but it's one I'm quite proud of, and was a whole lot quicker to edit down than the colour ones. The idea behind this collection was that we carried my old iPhone everywhere we went, and just snapped random things with little or no thought as to the composition or subject.
