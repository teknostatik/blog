I can't believe it's May already. And because it _is_ May, it's probably time for me to post a list of April's musical new releases that rocked my world. My Rough Trade album of the month was by Wand, and came on delicious red vinyl. The rest of this lot is pretty delicious too though.

Wand - Golem  
Nadine Shah - Fast Food  
Courtney Barnett - Sometimes I Sit And Think, And Sometimes I Just Sit  
Chilly Gonzales - Chambers  
Waxahatchee - Ivy Tripp  
Follakzoid - III  
Tobias Jesso Jr. - Goon  
East India Youth - Culture of Volume  
Godspeed You! Black Emperor - Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress  
Brian Wilson - No Pier Pressure  
Duke Special - Look Out Machines!  
Villagers - Darling Arithmetic  
Speedy Ortiz - Foil Deer
