May was largely about some of my musical heroes making good, unexpected, and unexpectedly good records. It was also a month where I travelled a fair bit (June will also be one of those months), and as a result I probably didn't listen to as much music as I would if I'd been at home all month.

I've not written much about [the new Jim O'Rourke album](http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20488-simple-songs/), and unfortunately it's not on Spotify (and won't be), but it really is exactly as good as I was expecting. I really didn't think he'd ever make a song based record again, and I've been playing it fairly constantly since I got back to the UK on Monday.

So the list for May 2015 looks something like this:

Django Django - Born Under Saturn Calexico - Edge of the Sun Peter Broderick - Colours of the Night Todd Rundgren - Global Todd Rundgren, Emil Nikolaison and Hans Peter Lindstrom - Runndans Jacco Gardner - Hypnophobia The Fall - Sub-Lingual Tablet (not on Spotify playlist) Death and Vanilla - Where the Wild Things Are Jim Oâ€™Rourke - Simple Songs (not on Spotify playlist) King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard - Quarters The Tallest Man on Earth - Dark Bird is Home
