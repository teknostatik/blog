_I realised this week that I have a single blog post for all my other **Album of the year** lists, and would probably regret doing 2019 in sections at some point. This blog post addresses this issue, and also has undergone some light editing to preserve the narrative._

I've been compiling a list of my favourite records of each year for a decade or more. This year I've listened to music slightly differently; with monthly Spotify playlists on shuffle during train journeys and walks, but otherwise by putting a record on my record player and listening to the songs in the order they were sequenced. These are my top 10, starting with something that came out during a surprisingly warm February.

### Ex:Re - _Ex:Re_

Ex:Re is the solo project of Elena Tonra (from Daughter), and this record is touched by heartbreak, but also by the realisation that you sometimes need to pick the pieces of other people out of your skin before you can start to heal. It's sparse and beautiful, and one of the most emotionally raw collections of songs I've heard this year.

### The Twilight Sad - _It Won/t Be Like This All the Time_

The second selection from my list of my favourite records from 2019 takes me back to the very start of the year.

Anyone who has known me for a while will know that The Twilight Sad are one of my favourite bands, and that their music often soundtracks the winter months for me. This year they delivered an excellent new record in January, which got me in the right head space for a couple of weeks of sub-zero cycling and an extremely challenging month at work (but it's good to get the worst month out of the way at the start of the year, right?).

### Weyes Blood - _Titanic Rising_

Part 3 of my list of my favourite records from 2019.

At this point I realise there are very few cheery records on this year's list. This one is probably the most uplifting musically, although lyrically it deals with climate change, and the growing sense that if we don't do something to avert the climate catastrophe then it doesn't really matter what else we do because we are underwater. This one is a grower, and nothing like what I usually listen to, but it's one I keep coming back to.

### Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds - _Ghosteen_

I said previously that there are very few cheery records on this list, and this one doesn't help. It is however one of the most beautiful pieces of music I've ever heard (this year or any other year), and it's a million miles away from where Nick Cave started all those years ago (check out Release the Bats by The Birthday Party for something a lot angrier). This reminds me of one of those books where you just have to read it all in one go. Partly to find out what happened and partly because it deserves your full attention until you have consumed it completely. I would be surprised if there is an album of the year list that doesn't include this record; it really is that good.

### Kate Tempest - _The Book of Traps & Lessons_

This is a record that definitely needs to be listened to in the order it is sequenced. It's also probably my favourite record by an artist who is responsible for at least one of my favourite records already (2016's _Let Them Eat Chaos_). Kate Tempest is a writer who also performs, and _The Book of Traps & Lessons_ is a single long poem put to music that demands to be listened to in one go. The music is much sparser than anything she has done before, but it allows the words to take centre stage as they should do. This record has probably provoked the most extreme emotional reaction of anything I've listened to this year, and I suspect I'll listen to it for many years to come.

### Belle & Sebastian - _Days of the Bagnold Summer_

This next record takes me back to September. I spent about half of September in Japan, and as a result couldn't buy this record until it had been out a couple of weeks. It was my soundtrack to that trip though (thanks to Spotify), and also to the desolate weather and subsequent mood crash that followed my return to the UK. Many people will know that Belle & Sebastian are one of my favourite bands, and this record serves as a great introduction to them, from the re-recordings of two old favourites to the newer songs that may themselves become old favourites in the years to come. They managed to provide at least two of my favourite songs of last year (_Cornflakes_ and _Best Friend_) and in _This Letter_ and _Safety Valve_ they have added two more songs that just seemed to perfectly sum up how I was feeling at the time I first listened to them. They have made better records, but for now this one will do nicely.

### The Delines - _The Imperial_

My seventh record of the year is from January, when 2019 was only a few days old. I loved the soulful gin-soaked vibe of the first Delines record (Colfax), and this one picks up very much where the last one left off. It's very much an album of stories, with clear narratives, believable characters (with names - which reminds me a bit of The Hold Steady), and songs that sound like they could have been written at any time since the early 70s. This isn't a fashionable record, and I suspect it won't be in many end of year lists, but it's one that is well worth giving a chance to if you are interested in well-written songs performed to perfection.

### Cigarettes After Sex - _Cry_

My 8th record of the year is much newer than most of the rest, but definitely deserves a place on this list. The first Cigarettes After Sex record was on my list in 2017, and I was wondering what direction they would go in next. The answer is very much that they are going in exactly the same direction, but are much closer to getting there. It's very much still all about crooning falsetto, shimmering guitars, and lyrics that don't look like anything special when written down, but which still manage to blend perfectly with the music; but if anything there are even more great songs this time around. This record sound-tracked most of November and December for me, and if the year started in November it would easily be my record of the year.

### Durand Jones & The Indications - _American Love Call_

This is a record that I got as part of my Rough Trade Club membership, and I don't think I would have given it a chance otherwise. From the cover I had it pegged as retro American soul, and while that's not too far off the mark there is something about this record that transcends genre and just transports me to America in the sunshine instead (not bad considering I've only ever been to America in December). Both vocalists can _really_ sing, there isn't a bad song on the record, and it has very quickly become the record I put on if I just want to feel _better_ about myself and the world for a little while.

### William Doyle - _Your Wilderness Revisited_

For my 10th selection I'm going to pick something that I've only owned for a few days, but which I've loved since the first time I've heard it. William Doyle used to record as East India Youth, but this record is very different than anything that has gone before, and swaps electronic music for something more organic and breathable. It still does a fair bit of genre-switching, but is on the whole a collection of excellent songs with clever and thoughtful lyrics. Words are important to me, and these words are perfect.
