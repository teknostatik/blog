This is an exact copy of my [Wordpress blog](https://andy.teknostatik.co.uk/), originally set up to experiment with moving a Wordpress blog to Github Pages.

I suspect I may end up liking this at least as much as Wordpress, because I can just write markdown files and not have to worry about anything else.
